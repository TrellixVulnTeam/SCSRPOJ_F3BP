agoda,It was during the time when you have to wake up in the morning and rest in the afternoon when the sounds of hammer and grillings came. Didnt get enough rest but the place is so awesome.,Oct,08,2017,76,pos,
agoda,I always book through agoda and is aleaysbhassle free. But this time we werent told that we have to pay extra Php3000 at the hotel for reservation fee. What if we only had exact money as was told at the checkout? Just wish the instruction and payment are clear.,Oct,07,2017,64,neg,

agoda,I will visit this Hotel soon... Very much recommended..,Sep,27,2017,68,pos,
agoda,Food has greatly improved in terms of taste and portioning.,Sep,26,2017,84,pos,
agoda,The amount of money I paid to the room we have chosen is not worth it  the room required refurbishment  10 000 php for a deluxe room in taal vista is not worth it compare to estancia tagaytay which I visited last year for the rooms I would recommend estancia but for the food taal vista is much better this is the only good part of staying in taal vista  the ammenities are very poor especially the kids room and gym really require a renovation should the management initiate in urgent basis.,Sep,25,2017,48,neg,
agoda,Stayed here last September 23-24 2017 with my girlfriend. We were celebrating our 10th year anniversary. With this  we were expecting a lot from this hotel given that this is one of the pioneer and high end hotels in Tagaytay. 1. We were booked at room 434 Mountain Wing. 2. The check in process took some time (around 10-15 min) since there were a lot of guests checking in/out during that time. This is totally understandable given this period. 3. We were given a room even before the check in time. We thought that it would be a perfect stay since we got lucky to get a room ahead. 4. As for the room  these are our observations and experiences: a) The room is quite old and not well maintained. b) The furniture like drawers are old and dirty. c) The cabinet where the refrigerator is stored was already broken. When I opened it  the door suddenly fell. d) The cabinet is very dirty. It is quite unhygienic to store your food/drinks here since it is dirty/dusty. e) The bar (refrigerator) is empty. Well  maybe because the cabinet is dirty so they didn't bother to place drinks inside the ref. f) Poor stability of the bed. When I sat down on the edge of the bed to remove my shoes  I thought the mattress will flip over. g) The room is not carpeted. h) They forgot to place fresh bathroom towels and robes. We needed to request this from the housekeeping. I'm not in a hospitality business or whatever but I'm pretty sure that this a standard protocol when new guests will use a hotel room. i) The bathroom is spacious but it is very evident that it is not well maintained. The tiles were shaking (loose) when you step on it. Plus  the pressure of the bidet was too strong. Not sure if this was adjustable since I tried rotating the valve but it was super tight. j) The curtains were torn and looks very old and overused. k) Saw a dead cockroach at the lobby of Mountain Wing. l) The blower where not functioning properly when my gf used it. Also  the vanity mirror was not well lit. m),Sep,25,2017,48,neg,
agoda,The lady receptionist told my wife that the room we booked was unavailable and offered other rooms but we had to pay additional fee. When I approached my wife and the receptionist and was told about this  I complained why the room that had already been booked could be unavailable. When the receptionist saw that I was not going to allow this to happen  she told us that she would try to talk to manager at the back. After a minute  she came back and said that they would just upgrade our room for free. But this incident left a bad taste in the mouth.,Sep,23,2017,68,neg,
agoda,Very freindly staff and a lot varient food especial in bfast buffet and so neat the hotel but not so around in facilities because got typhoon,Sep,13,2017,88,pos,
agoda,We selected this hotel solely on it's view and location. The staff was friendly enough. But the room was outdated and the shower/tub was terrible  very difficult to stand up. I would only stay here again based on the view alone.,Sep,08,2017,56,neg,
agoda,We enjoy our stay... place is beautiful  food is good and good location.,Sep,06,2017,72,pos,
agoda,Lovely hotel with a well trained staff to serve you and meet every need. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. We were disappointed that the equipment in the Fitness Center needed repairs (weight resistant machine  treadmill). We enjoy beginning the day with exercise but the Fitness Center is in need of attention. I could not get the A/C to work so it was hot and humid. Breakfast buffet was excellent. The lady chef cooks a really great omelette.,Sep,05,2017,84,neg,
agoda,Great helpful staff  even greater location. I prefer staying in the new wing as the old wing needs some renovation. Good buffet.,Aug,31,2017,92,pos,
agoda,we took the presidential suite but the hotel failed our expectation. checking inn was horrible and they did not even brought us to our room but instead the cleaner guided us. the bathroom needs refurbishing. the breakfast should be served since it is the presidential suite.. you still need to pay 150 pesos for the valet and queque just to pay it. the breakfast serving is horrible.  agoda charge us 497 dollars but the hotel charge us 30 thousand pesos and thats 100 dollars discrepancy. its just that we took the presidential suite and we also expect VIP treatment. the hotel is in prime location but the service is disgusting and so poor..,Aug,29,2017,48,neg,
agoda,The view of Taal Lake was amazing from the balcony of our room and definitely worth it!,Aug,28,2017,100,pos,
agoda,We did not have good dining experience  breakfast was ok  evening meal buffet is not good value and Al-a Carte was dismal  we went to Mcdonald`s across the road for our 2nd evening.,Aug,25,2017,84,neg,
agoda,Great view of Taal lake from the room. Great food. The couch from our room has stains already and personally it's due for a new one as it is afterall a luxury hotel. But overall stay was great. We've always love Taal Vista,Aug,24,2017,84,pos,

agoda,"I think that it is TOP Class in the Philippine level. Shower A lot of hot water, comfortable. We also had many kinds of breakfast buffet. The scenery of Lake Tar seen from the hotel is also superb.",Aug,18,2017,100,pos,
agoda,Been a Taal Vista regular for years now. However  last visit was disappointing. Made arrangements for a simple birthday surprise as I did before  but it seems like they no longer care  unlike previous years. Add to that  upon checking in our room - not the usual impressed and wow feeling...no bed runner  no throw pillows  Welcome note and goodies (usually fruits or pastries) the bathroom still had splatters on the glass  grout on the bathroom floors are visibly dirty  and into night - the aircon had a leak. Still gave it a shot for dinner  went to try the dinner buffet  but the selection was quite limited. I love Taal Vista - proposed to my wife there  also stayed there for our wedding  but maintenance and upkeep of the place has to step up. It's in the details  I guess. A great hotel experience goes down to the smallest of details. Time to explore the new options in Tagaytay. To the Management  please save Taal Vista  too many memories :(,Aug,07,2017,60,neg,
agoda,Buffet breakfast selection was great  so many choices. Great staff from front desk to room attendants. Will definitely book again here!,Aug,07,2017,84,pos,

agoda,It had a nice getaway at Taal Vista with a spacious and comfortable room. The view was awesome! I booked the Premiere Lake View room. It was really nice that I can stay in my room the whole day.,Aug,01,2017,88,pos,
agoda,The hotel had a good location. Very near attractions and restaurants and also some parts were just newly renovated. I hope they could also renovate the rooms bec it's starting to look and feel old. The sliding door to the washroom doesn't work properly. The rooms at the mountain side needs renovation.,Jul,31,2017,80,neg,

agoda,excellent view of the lake. good buffet selection during breakfast.,Jul,24,2017,88,pos,
agoda,We stayed on the lake wing  premier king. The room is clean  thee bed is comfortable  the best part of staying here is the view from our room is superb. Their is a garden right below the veranda of the room  that when you open the door what you can here is the peaceful sound of the birds. We stayed here before on a weekend  and our recent stay was on a midweek. You can enjoy more the place during midweek because they have less guest  I mean  you can enjoy more roaming around and use their pool more  check in or out more faster. But  if you'll be staying here on a weekend  their breakfast has wider selection than what they do offer during midweek. Parking is free  another thumbs up. The only downside I got same as my previous stay was their bathroom has no bidet. They even just have the shower head on the top of the bath tub   they don't have the movable shower. I rated 3* 4* their cleanliness and facilities because the sofa inside our room has stains and a little ruin  probably because of its beige color  I even had a doubt at first if will seat or not. lol Overall  our stay was pleasant.,Jul,21,2017,84,pos,
agoda,Although we had issues during check in and there was no view from our room  our stay became memorable. It was a great venue for celebrating a wedding and at the same time family reunion. I appreciated the room attendant who cleaned our room  the guard who watched over us in the pool. and people serving at the buffet breakfast.,Jul,19,2017,52,pos,

agoda,Booked this for my folks as their wedding anniversary gift and they enjoyed it.,Jul,07,2017,88,pos,
agoda,The location gives you the best view of taal but we're just caught off guard that we had to pay more if we want the lake view room. We just thought they are a bit pricey  when we can just eat in their restaurant and enjoy the view for a couple of hours.,Jul,05,2017,84,pos,
agoda,Celebrated Father's Day with our children. The staff are kind enough to let us check in earlier  we also got a complimentary merienda during our stay,Jul,04,2017,92,pos,

agoda,Enjoy the stay,Jun,28,2017,92,pos,
agoda,Stayed at their mountain wing. Room size was okay with 2 twin beds and a day bed. Disappointed though with their bathroom. Toilet seat cover is broken or not attached properly. Bathroom fixtures are old and needs replacement - faucet can't be closed properly - water was dripping. No hot water available in our shower on the first night. I hope they renovate the mountain wing soon. The Lake wing looks really nice.,Jun,27,2017,80,neg,
agoda,Taal vista Hotel is a top choice in tagaytay and will likely remain so for years to come because it balances location  view  spacious design and history with an acceptable price. Though it has to deal with getting older and of need of possible renovations  my family and I like very much the overall feel of what we get and what we expect from a 4-5 star provincial hotel. We will definitely come back and look forward to a longer stay here.,Jun,27,2017,72,pos,
agoda,Everyone I deal with were very accomadating and the young lady at the register upgrade my room from mountain view to a lake View! with no xtra charge which was more than expected!! if I ever decided to come back to Manila I would go back there and stay for a week instead of 3 nights!!,Jun,26,2017,100,pos,

agoda,Nice view and staff are friendly,Jun,18,2017,80,pos,
agoda,Despite the long line during check in and out. I was surprise that it only took us around 10mins  also baggage was delivered instantly as soon as we got in to our room. The room was big enough for 2 adults and 3 kids but not meticulously cleaned (flies in the room). It was walking distance to sky ranch which was really favorable for us since we are traveling with r kids 11  3 and 2 yo. We tried going to the game room but unfortunately all the board games and chess board which was indicated in the list was unavailable.We also checked out the play are for small kids but TV wasnt working so you couldnt play with the Xbox. All in all our stay here was average. With the amount we paid I'm sure will be getting better deals somewhere else.,Jun,16,2017,80,pos,
agoda,We had a wonderful overnight stay at the Hotel. Great view and very helpful staff members. Though we had an issue on the door lock of one of our rooms  the staff and mamager was able to fix it ASAP. Check-in and check-out was a a breeze. Ample parking space as well.,Jun,13,2017,96,pos,
agoda,The facilities are good particularly the buffet meals. The staff was not particular to the request of the guests. We were inquiring for the dinner and was advised that they will call us regarding the inquiry but we didnt receive any call.. Apparently the staff forgot about it.,Jun,05,2017,92,pos,
agoda,Restaurant and hotel like a tomb with nobody to be seen  could not believe i could not buy/upgrade to a view even for $$ with only 60% capacity. Cold shower  faulty TV  no internet  view of concrete. Paid the kings ransom to eat in restaurant buffet  which is fantastic  but that's the only positive. Stayed there many times before  but won't be back again after this last effort.,Jun,04,2017,60,neg,

agoda,The juices were made of syrup rather than fresh. This being Tagaytay  the Pineapple Juice should be at least fresh. Still  a good experience.,May,22,2017,80,pos,
agoda,Kindly give first to participants of the conferences the rooms near function rooms. We were given a room (rm148) just beside the hall where they dine and smoke. We cant stay on the balcony coz of the noise and smoke.,May,19,2017,84,neg,

agoda,Stayed in mountain wing  room is showing its age. Need more maintenance. Balcony light not working  safe box not working  bed is sinking  hot water pressure is poor. The good are the staff and decent breakfast. But for the price paid not so value for money.,May,18,2017,56,neg,
agoda,The buffet breakfast had only few choices of food  we were surprised with so many peiple eating and high class hotel you can count how many food they serve on breakfast not so much choices not worth the money,May,16,2017,76,neg,

agoda,I booked here and make a note that me and my wife will celebrate our 2nd anniversary with my 10months old baby. And what a surprise we have a welcome cake in our room with a beautiful view. But the beds are two single. I asked the bell boy if we can transfer to a room with king size bed 'coz we are family and we can't sleep in separate beds. And after a few minutes the bell boy assisted us to transfer to a new room.and it was great because the room is huge for the 3 of us. All the staffs are kind and joyful as they are always greeting and smiling wherever we saw them. The food is great as its buffet breakfast. I love the coffee(kapeng barako)which is very famous in Town.,May,06,2017,92,pos,

agoda,big rooms  friendly staff  great breakfast,Apr,20,2017,96,pos,
agoda,I was offered a room upgrade for an additional 500 pesos. They said it has a view of the lake but I was placed in a room facing the road. I didn't complain because I just had to walk over to the other side to see the view. Besides it was a bigger room. What I didn't realize was how the vehicles speeding the highway in the wee hours  would disrupt my sleep. There weren't too many (maybe 3x)  but enough to wake me up. Loved the buffet breakfast though.,Apr,19,2017,88,pos,

agoda,This is a vacation place for the local. There's a theme park and a small mall right next to the hotel. Stayed there for a seminar so had all my meals in the hotel. Food is good. Nice view from the room. Hotel property is big and not tall so need to walk a bit to the rooms. You will need a car or have to take a cab wherever you go. No public transport available at the hotel.,Apr,14,2017,80,neg,
agoda,not worth the money. so expensive for a very outdated rooms and facilities. Many other new and more beautiful nearby.,Apr,13,2017,60,neg,
agoda,The location could not have been better in Tagaytay- a short drive from many attractions  and the view was spectacular. The Lake Wing especially has incredible views. The Mountain Wing is pretty run down and poorly maintained  which was quite disappointing.,Apr,07,2017,60,neg,

agoda,Pros- cool weather  place near every must-go places in Tagaytay   taal lake view  friendly staff  clean place  view at the mountain wing Cons- room's a bit old and not sound proof-you'll hear the noise from the hallway   pool not heated-my kid loves swimming but unable to swim because of the cool weather  Veranda always full during breakfast but good thing they have other rooms available like the lounge and at the Taza resto,Mar,17,2017,80,neg,

agoda,Hotel come with perfect view. Nice to stay for holidays.,Mar,14,2017,88,pos,
agoda,The room they gave us upon check in was not what I expected. I reserved and paid for a room that's premium with a full mountain view. They gave us a room in the basement of their old wing. It was very gloomy  not a full mountain view at all  quite far from their facilities & not accesible to any lift. After speaking to their manager on duty  she was very professional  accomodating and transfered us a much better room. We appreciated the gesture. In my opinion  they need to review their coffee shop & room service menu. It's boring and can be improved to match their 4 star hotel category.,Mar,13,2017,72,pos,

agoda,Due to its location  the hotel does not have much competition within its category. Therefore it can be seen as the best hotel  however  it definitely has opportunities to improve  especially in the price range it asks for. Good 1. Beautiful View of the sea 2. Nice lounge 3. Buffet is quite good Opportunities 1.Wifi is very inconsistent and limited 2. I have to walk every day at least 4-6 minutes from my room to the main area (lobby  lounge  etc). quite far 3. The restroom (in my room at least) can use some rennovation as its quite old,Feb,06,2017,72,pos,

agoda,Our group of classmates elected to stay in this resort hotel to have our reunion activities and much to our dismay  the resort hotel failed to meet our bare minimum expectations. The registration process was tedious  disorganized and quite lengthy. The rooms and amenities were jut average. The electronic and projection equipments provided were faulty. The food was just average.The hotel was expecting a horde of people to check in but made no adequate provisions to handle this.,Jan,23,2017,44,neg,
agoda,Great food in Taza Restaurant. Worth the money. Soon after we checked in and unpacked our things in the room  a staff unlocked the door of our room from the outside without knocking. It was a very rude behavior. He did not apologize and merely said that he was checking the room. Obviously not a good reason not to knock.,Jan,23,2017,80,pos,
agoda,Perfect and excellent location to stay for. A Morning breeze and fresh air breath experience. Friendly and accomodated hotel staff. Should have a complimentry drinks upon arrival. Should have a best value room rates for family 6/8 members. Should have a more variety of foods to select for every meal. Best value meal for customers where breakfast not included in booking. But overall assestment- Taal Vista Hotel excellent for company seminars  team buildings wherein they can demand high hotel rates. But for clients wanted for family bonding  family get together  debut  birfhdays etc ... it is not recommended. It is recommended for high payed costumer. Taal Vista- a hotel evryone's dream for staycation and vacation but at a best value room rates that everybody can afford to check in. Workshops.,Jan,22,2017,84,pos,

We still slept together in one small bed as we cannot sleep separately.,Jan,08,2017,100,pos,
agoda,We've missed our itinerary and the hotel ruined a supposed surprise for a family member because of very poor service during check in. A very embarassing situation caused!

agoda,Be careful when booking because the website is misleading. A room on the lake wing does not mean you get a lake view. To get a lake view you must book a premier room  and frankly  the garden view doesn't look over a garden at all. Instead  the garden view looked over the back-of-house delivery/parking area and is not worth the price. After all  the reason to visit this hotel is for the lake view. We visited between Christmas and New Year and surprisingly the hotel was not adequately staffed to look after the rush of guests (i.e. breakfast was a nightmare). The rush should have been properly planned-for by hotel management.,Jan,02,2017,80,neg,
agoda,My family of 6 stayed from December 30  2016 to January 1  2017. It was our first time to stay at Taal Vista since we normally go to Baguio for New Year's Eve celebrations. Partied with the rest of the guests at the Countdown party which was a blast. The 2 bands played great music from the 80's! Our room which was the Deluxe King Bed - MountainView was spacious enough although the tub was quite too narrow for our liking. Might cause accidents if one is not careful. As a constructive criticism  for the high room rate being charged to guests  maybe management should consider refurbishing a little to maintain 5 star rating. Not sure if the Lake view rooms are more modern-looking. All staff are so friendly and courteous with a ready smile and attended to all our needs quickly and efficiently. Special mention to Denise from the front desk and Imee (one of the servers at the countdown party). We got a bowl of fruits on our 2nd day and some cookies and marshmallows for the kids too. It was a sweet gesture. Kids loved the sprawling lawns of the hotel and had a fun time sliding down the small slopes. They love that since we live in a condo and there's not much room for play. As a mom  I enjoyed that playtime with them. From the hotel  there is an easy access to the Sky Ranch amusement park but gate closes at 6pm. We got coupons from the front desk at half the price. In a nutshell  it was a great experience and we will be back!,Jan,02,2017,92,pos,

I went out for lunch and was back at 1PM only to be told that the room has not been cleaned yet since the room service was still cleaning the rooms near my assigned room. I waited again but there was nowhere to go since it was raining hard in tagaytay. Went back to the front desk at 230PM and now their reason was that the aircon in the room i was assigned needs to be fixed! The experience was so frustrating and to experience this in a 4star hotel is beyond words. Better to choose other boutique hotels in the vicinity they might have better and faster ways of checking you in!,Dec,18,2016,48,neg,
agoda,This hotel has the best view of the taal lake and volcano. We love the location as it is very accessible. It is also just beside sky ranch. The staff were very nice and greets you whenever you come across them. This hotel needs some updates in their facilities as it shows the age of the property  it exudes luxury however  some of the facilities look rather outdated. The carpet in front of the ballroom looks aging and it needs an extreme makeover.

agoda,1. the system is not updated. I was told that i booked 5 rooms but i only booked 3 rooms. I have a room cancellation more than a week before our reservation and i still have to use my data just to let them see my confirmation of cancellation. 2. The first room was given to us at around 12:30pm and I was pleasant about it  but then the 2 other rooms was given to us as late as 5pm. The check in time is 2pm. We should already be enjoying our stay for that 3 hours and yet we were pissed by waiting that long. 3. When the room was given to us  the other room smells like vomit. And the other room that was given to us was at the other building. We went there as family with senior and a 1 year old child. How can we enjoy it when my other relatives were way far. 4. The other rooms didnt have shampoos and conditioner. 5. I asked for an extra pillow at around 5:30pm. The pillow was given to me at 8:30pm  about 5 to 10 minutes after i was angrily followed up my request. 6. i dialled 3 to request a chopstick since it was written there. Then the operator told me to just dialled i think 7 or 6 for my request. They should have just connect me to the right operator (thats how it supposed to be right?)

To be fair  I booked the accomodation online and they were not prewarned that we have a four-month old baby with us and we dont have a babysitter. However  upon check in  they must have seen our situation but they did not initiate our transfer. In the morning we went to veranda for the breakfast buffet. The staff said that there was no small tables available for us so she suggested that we return to the restautant near our room. She did not offer the available larger table to us even if she saw that we were having a hard time carrying our baby and his stuff (stroller & baby bag). They couldve have told us when we checked the option of having breakfast elsewhere- near our room knowing our less ideal situation. My wife had to ask the staff if we could have breakfast outside the veranda. They allowed us but I felt disappointed because they lack the iniative to think of ways to ease our situation.,Nov,17,2016,68,neg,

It took 30 minutes of waiting until we were transferred to a different room. The new room was even awful  the views of trees and grass were gone and it was replaced by a view of wall. It was really a very bad experience. We thought that the price of this hotel speaks for itself but we were wrong. It is an expensive hotel with not so accommodating staff and not so clean facilities.

agoda,My family and I had an overnight stay 2 weeks ago... we got the Mountain View Suite (2 bedrooms  Receiving and Dining Area). We were supposed to check in at 2pm (or was it 3pm) but due to a broken AC  we were able to check in at 4.30 pm. If we only knew that only 1 AC is broken  we could have at least put our luggages in and we had started hanging out. But for some reason  the staff didn't tell us right away the problem. But despite of that  we didn't make a scene in the lobby and the Duty Manager was very apologetic anyway. Sh*t happens as they say and both parties never wanted it anyway. The DM offered a free SPA but we said  we just wanted to put down out things so we can go out. When they found out that it's ok with us to let the AC fix while we're away  they gave the card keys and told us we can have a late checkout (till 5pm) the following day. The Suite is superb! We got complimentary fruit platter  chocolate cake and I think 8-10 non-alcoholic beverages. Good thing as well is that I think  all of the Managers were aware of the trouble we had during the check in so everytime we passed by the lobby.. they kept on apologizing :D Upon check out  I told them that we consumed 1 bottle of Smirnoff but they did not charge it anymore  well  just to make up for the trouble hehehe... The place is perfect! Great view of the Taal Lake/Volcano.. even if we got the Mountain View Suite  we have a view of the Taal Volcano :) The View Deck is clean... the food is delish (breakfast buffet).. the amenities and wonderful :) Will be back here for sure!,Nov,02,2016,96,pos,

How stupid and inconsiderate!

agoda,Dont book at Lake Wing if you're with an elderly cause it's far from the reception and breakfast hall. You might wanna park also at the other building or basement. Bathroom has no bidet. But the cherry on top of our stay was the beautiful sunset from our veranda. Book Lake Wing if you want to experience the panoramic view of Taal Volcano. But if you're always on the go  just book the cheaper ones.,Sep,07,2016,72,pos,
agoda,Cool weather versatile for rest and relaxation except swimming not advisable due to cold pool. Value for money will be excellent if with addl perks like free fruits and wine or free cocktail drinks. Although room is excellent as it is.,Sep,07,2016,92,pos,
agoda,I have positive and negative things to say about Taal Vista. Positive: Staying at the hotel  you can never get bored. There's a kids club for the kids  and other facilities (gym  pool - but we didn't use them). Food is awesome  their breakfast buffet has a variety of food choices. Negative: We were offered an upgrade for a bigger room at the new wing. I wonder how new that wing was  because the elevator we used  musty. The room that we initially stayed at (we asked for a room change)  broken bathroom door. Honestly  the upgrade wasn't worth it. When we were also going to our room  this is past the checkin time now. The hallway is lined with used food trays and majority of the rooms are still being cleaned.,Sep,06,2016,80,pos,
agoda,Only gripe would be the check in and check out. Took so long to go inside the room despite reserving it a day before. Said check in was at 10 am and I was there at 8am. Clearance is also a little slow. So it took around 20 minutes before we finally checked out of the hotel.,Sep,06,2016,88,pos,
agoda,It's realy a nice location  my friends enjoyed their stay so much.,Sep,03,2016,96,pos,
agoda,Stayed in this hotel in Aug 2016. Facilities were amazing. Swimming pool was small though. The bathroom was nice with separate toilet  bath and sink. I just didn't like that it was just divided by glass. No physical door to seclude the bathroom from the bedroom. They gave us a nice cake for our anniversary. There were refreshments (cucumber citrus i think) while waiting for check-in. By the way  check-in took too long maybe because it was a long weekend and the hotel was packed with guests. But we still enjoyed the facilities and the tagaytay environnment.,Sep,03,2016,100,pos,
agoda,our first room didn't smell good  however after a few minutes we were transferred to a better accommodation. Elder individuals should be cautious of the bath tub as this might prove to be a bit slippery in climbing in.,Sep,02,2016,80,pos,
agoda,Great food  friendly staff  delicious food and awesome day spa with great massages,Sep,01,2016,88,pos,
agoda,generally  I think we will not go back to this hotel anymore.,Sep,01,2016,64,neg,
agoda,Everything else was ok  the place food and the weather. But the way the room was kept was very bad. We checked in at 8pm giving the establishment much time to clean. But when we got in and check the bathroom  there we falling hair scattered in the place and the bathtub was still wet. Though rooms are a bit old  they should do something with the scent.. It would have been a perfect location. I hope they renovate their rooms soon and housekeeping should improve.,Aug,31,2016,60,pos,

agoda,very nice view. but my room was with lake view  it was very far from lobby and restaurant and coffee,Aug,13,2016,92,pos,
agoda,Check In was a loooooong wait. Booked two rooms. I got the second room around 4pm. I was told that I was going to be called to inform me when the second room is available but that never happened. I tried calling the front desk a couple of times but no one answered. I had to go to the front desk and wait in line again just to know whether my second room is available or not. thankfully it was. I actually had to challenge for my first room beddings. I booked a king and a single bed room which was pretty clear in this sites description. Front Desk lady at that time said there was no room of that type and had to ask another colleague. Until they just suggested to provide an additional single bed in my first room. As we enter the second room  true enough there was indeed a proper king and single type room. Breakfast - I'm fine with walking from one end of the property to another but imagine I can just imagine how hard it would be for someone who has problems walking. From Room 110 of Mountain view to Breakfast buffet area (Ballroom 2-3) in Lake view side. No elevators. Food itself was ok. Other than the above  all else were fine but nothing great. Can be better.,Aug,12,2016,64,pos,
agoda,There was a long queue during check in. We were finally served at 330pm and Receptionist informed us that there is no room available yet despite my confirmed booking at the Lake View section of the hotel. Keys to our room was given at 415pm. To my dismay  our room has no view of the lake. Anyways  room is not cleaned well  I saw used bedroom sleepers under the bed and a lot of dust/dirt. There is even no enough tissue in the toilet (only 1 roll is installed in the toilet). AC is not cold. Location of Taal Vista is the main reason why I booked here. Near to anywhere.,Aug,11,2016,48,pos,
agoda,Do not book Lake Wing rooms as the check in a disaster  the rooms no door for the bathroom and the view from the rooms is terrible at best.,Aug,11,2016,60,pos,
agoda,I used to like this hotel. I have stayed here before and the previous experiences were good. This time  however  was disappointing. Ill summarise: Good: 1. Staff - very friendly and accomodating. 2. Location - ideally located. Bad: 1. Stains on the couch. 2. Mini-bar was absolutely empty. 3. Incomplete room items. We noticed no bathrobes and razors. We called and requested for them  and they arrived 2 HOURS LATER. I don't know what changed  but this was a very disappointing visit to this hotel  which was once the go-to place in Tagaytay.,Aug,10,2016,56,neg,
agoda,Please improve Breakfast quality and location. You have nice view from hotel. You should provide Breakfast space with Taal Volcano View. Anyway  It was nice hotel.,Aug,09,2016,72,pos,
agoda,While we have been to many hotels around the World  sometimes we come across a hotel that is rated as a 5 star but certainly is not  the Taal Vista Hotel in Tagaytay is one of these establishments. Although there are some nice aspects  this hotel in my opinion is way overrated and would be a 3 or 3.5 star hotel at best. As you can see by the photos  the view is incredible. What is sad is that you pay dearly for this view and it is available at many dozens of locations for half the cost. The facilities are dated (hotel was originally built in 1939)  but it does not have the regal charm of a hotel erected in that era. Instead it looks like an average facility that is desperately attempting to keep up with the times  but they are failing badly. They are even too cheap to buy a lawnmower and literally mow huge areas with a weed eater. This makes the grounds look hideous. The breakfast was basically the same every day overcooked eggs  Tang served as Orange Juice (not one bit of juice in the mixture)  stale bread and overall nothing like a five star buffet. All of this was put in a conference room as their normal restaurant was being renovated (something they neglected to mention when I made my reservation). Even the newspaper provided at breakfast was two days old. The food served in the lobby caf was poor as well. We sat for a very long time before acknowledged  they brought us a dish we did not ask for  did not bring what we ordered and even charged us for the unwanted item. Grossly over-priced for what we got! If we wanted to use their car service to return home  the charge was 5 TIMES the cost that we paid for a private sedan to bring us here! Double might fly with me  but five times for the same service and distance is ridiculous! The rooms are adequate  but average. We wanted to get a larger room but according to the online reservations no larger rooms exist in the hotel. Bathrooms are a bit dated and the bathtub is so badly narrow,Aug,09,2016,64,neg,
agoda,The stay was awesome  good location and good view..checking in just took time since only one staff was assisting and the other was on the phone. The one over the phone didn't asked or inquire of our need and had eye contact with him already but when he saw a foreigner came he quickly asked and processed his check-in. So much for being a filipino  Anyways all was good except for that  satisfactory.,Aug,07,2016,88,pos,
agoda,Words cannot express but this place is just awesome ,Aug,03,2016,84,pos,
agoda,Visitor has to take note booking Mountain View wing (old structure) while Lake View Wing (newer facilities). A weekend treat was unpleasant due to uncivilized guest adjacent room noisy late night till wee hours. Front desk unable to answer telephone. Bath towels old as well not in class with the hotel rating  need to replace to bring better standard. Talking with Resto Manager Ms. Cristina was a big relief and very responsive staff. Now under better management wishing the hotel will regain the prestige as Tagaytay's Best.,Jul,30,2016,80,pos,

agoda,Premium Lake Side Room: Upon checking in we were offered an upgrade to a premium room for an additional 1 500 pesos which we gladly accepted. Our first day was ok. Wi-Fi was excellent. However  when we woke up the first morning there was a puddle of water due to a leaking split type A/C. Luckily our boys were still asleep and my husband was able to place one of the robes before anyone slips on their tile floor. They had their engineering service come to fix the leak. He came back a short time later to fix the leak again. The 3rd time they had the engineering manager assess the problem which he concluded was a problem with the drainage and he called front desk to have us relocate to another room. Upon getting settled to the second room  the shower smelled musty and there was a group of flying insects all gathered in one lower left corner of the shower stall. House keeping came and sprayed with lysol and said it was resolved. But upon checking the insects were now on the ceiling and towels. We asked to be relocated again. Everything was fine with the 3rd room but come night time as we were getting ready for bed the split type A/C started dripping again. Engineering came and fixed the problem. Then as we were about to fall asleep there was this dragging noise coming from above our room that continued till past midnight. Front desk claims that security already went and assessed the area and found no disturbance but the noise continued. We called the front desk 4 times before the noise stopped. Altogether we lost more than half of the day during our first full day. We couldn't leave due to the ongoing problems. We lost half of our nights sleep from our second night. Breakfast Buffet: Our two sons availed for the morning breakfast buffet only to be stopped by a lady who told my younger son that he may not join their breakfast wearing a tank top. My sons went back to our room to change but when they got in they saw two other kids with a tank top on. Complete disapp,Jul,18,2016,52,neg,
agoda,I am very pleased with my stay here  I booked a room in the mountain ridge wing; the bed is very huge can accommodate as much as 3 persons. I love the balcony wherein you can see portion of the Taal Lake while having a cup of coffee or any of your favorite drink. If you love Breakfast Buffet you'll surely love their complimentary breakfast  there's a huge variety of food whether Filipino or American dishes. 5 stars for the staff's they're very accommodating and will attend all your needs in just one call. All is well when you stay here in Taal Vista Hotel.,Jul,17,2016,92,pos,

agoda,Location and Good Service but have lost the good old days of Taal Vista Lodge.,Jul,11,2016,68,neg,
agoda,Pros: - Their restaurant was fantastic. The food was delicious. Highly recommend the sole. - The view from the Lake View rooms makes for great pictures. - The hotel is located near all the major must-sees and restaurants in Tagaytay. There's plenty of parking as well. - Get a massage in your room! It was relaxing and they were polite. - Room service came on time and everything we ordered was satisfactory. Cons: - Big floor space for the bathroom but the tub was so small that you couldn't stand for a shower with two feet flat on the ground. The curve was so narrow that I kept feeling like I was going to fall over. There was no hot water. The shower head was broken so it was only one stream of extremely high pressured water (painful). The toilette uses recycled water (which is fine) but the water reeked of sewage and stank up the bathroom. The fixtures were dirty and broken. - My parent's room had a broken door to the balcony so they couldn't close it. Their air conditioner was dripping too. This was dangerous as they were both senior citizens. - The food at the lobby cafe was disappointing. The cakes were stale and dry although the hot chocolate was fine.,Jul,11,2016,64,neg,
agoda,clean big hotel but the food is not that good far from the main entrance.,Jul,11,2016,80,pos,
agoda,At time of arrival  we have requested of an early check-in but instead they have given us a late checking  they promise for an hour but end up waiting for 1 1/2 hour  the food on the lobby cafe taste good but the hot drinks wasnt really HOT  the receptionist was so polite  however her action was more on showing the SOP rather than really communicating to the guest. We were amazed of the scenery on their viewing deck and garden but some part of the hotel was under renovation which was kind a disturbing. Our plan was to go early at the skyranch  but due to the late booking we end up with coming late and the rain was already pouring and we didnt enjoy all the nice ride  (wasting the entrance fee). Coming back to the hotel In the evening we were expecting to have a peaceful night and good sleep but end up waking in the middle of the night due to some guests who were trying to open our door harshly and to my surprise 4 men were outside INCLUDING a hotel personnel who did'nt even think that they might be opening the wrong Room!!!???. And in the morning swimmingpool was closed  they say its because of the bad weather - this day wasn't really FOR US... But I will recommend the place to my friends because of the Nice Sceneries and garden,Jul,11,2016,32,neg,

agoda,We have been to Tagaytay for quite a number of times but this is the first time we decided to have a spontaneous weekend vacation in Taal Vista Hotel. Our stay in Taal Vista Hotel was very refreshing .. Away from metro manila but not to far from metro manila. We stayed by the Mountain Wing .. It was generally nice  peaceful and we truly enjoyed our 3D/2N weekend staycation. But since Mountain Wing side is the oldest side of the hotel you can somehow feel its old ambiance  maybe a little repainting can cure it. It was clean but the shower curtain kindda smell damped. I wish they check on that  but over all it was a good stay and a very peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle over crowded manila. Food was great. Good enough for everyone who came for the breakfast buffet. Maybe next time i will try staying by the Lake Side Wing.. Its their newer bldg. ,Jul,07,2016,84,pos,
agoda,Taal Vista Lodge is a comfortable setting to enjoy Tagaytay. Great views to Lake Taal,Jul,06,2016,72,pos,
agoda,Checked in on a Sunday night hoping to wake up to the view of Taal Lake and Volcano. We were given a room on the 3rd floor of the left wing. Noticed handprints on the glass windows and the room starting to look a little dated. Looked forward to waking up to the nice view but alas  it was obstructed by well fog  and by the tops of the trees in front. Also chose this hotel for the fabled breakfast overlooking the lake. Only to have it in one of the ballrooms because Cafe Veranda is under renovation till September. The hotel could use some updating in terms of interiors. And it should. i guess for now the only thing worth what you pay for when choosing this hotel is the view which you can appreciate from the deck. And the pan de coco and Spanish bread from the cake shop. The breads from the buffet breakfast were also better than in most hotels so kudos to the bakers of the hotel. Wait staff during breakfast were also very nice  along with the guard on the 3rd floor who escorted us when checking out. And the front desk and valets. Hope hotel management can do much-needed renovations soon.,Jul,05,2016,68,pos,
agoda,we enjoyed staying at this hotel because of good locations and cool climate,Jul,04,2016,64,pos,

agoda,It would be better if they would have more F&B staff during breakfast. They have a lot of guests  that could fill up a ballroom  but they have very limited staff. Some simple requests  like coffee and tea - breakfast defaults  were not served even after a few follow ups.,Jul,04,2016,76,pos,

agoda,had a chance to stay at the old wing and the new wing in different occassions (old wing is very close to the Sky Ranch and noisy too). better facilities and doesnt smell like molds in the new wing. they mixed up our bags this time and it took hours before we can get the matter resolved with the staff. location is at the center of everything. Taal Vista is a classic  can't go wrong,Jun,30,2016,88,pos,
agoda,The only issue was the room service time for meals and restaurant dine-in time. It seemed understaffed which may been due to the reinvention of the normal dinning area and kitchen aside from that everything was great.,Jun,30,2016,96,pos,

We had prepaid for the room and indicated the time of arrival but it was of no avail. The room was poorly decorated and the linen was stale. The shower was also not working well and the toilet bowl was stained. The experience was 3 -star and not 5-star.,Jun,27,2016,48,neg,

agoda,we stayed over the weekend for father's day celebration and we were really looking forward to it since it was our first time staying in Taal Vista. we have been planning and saving for it. we stayed in one of the premier rooms overlooking Taal Lake and there was a series of disappointing events during our stay. first  our AC was not working and we had to call several times  my son and i could not sleep and when my husband called  already agitated and almost to the point of cursing  they went ahead and transferred us to another room. earlier in the night  we ordered room service  it took more than 40 minutes and the food was already cold when it arrived. in our new room  the AC was leaking  good thing i saw it early on otherwise i could have slipped (and i am pregnant for that matter!) at lunch time the next day we ordered food again (i know  we didn't learn) it took more than one hour and the food was cold again when it arrived and only after several follow ups. i admit the view from our room was really great but you can get the same view from any other hotels along the ridge for lesser amount of money. when we checked out  the duty manager talked to us and apologized  he said he wished he could have talked to us earlier so he could have done something but then he also said he saw our complaints in their record which means he could have reached out to us and not wait until we were checking out. we were really disappointed and promised not to stay in this hotel again. we didn't get the value for our money - it's not worth it!,Jun,21,2016,56,neg,
agoda,Our family always enjoy staying at TVH. The place is very warm and the staff always smiles. Some points of improvement for Mountain wing as we got a total of 6 rooms - The fridge is dirty and didn't really work properly. Some bathroom doors cannot be locked and my sisters room had clogged shower area. It also seems like the pool is small for a big hotel. Overall  TVH is so lovely we keep on coming back,Jun,20,2016,76,pos,

The room looks so dull. the only compensation are the staff who are very friendly and courteous.,Jun,06,2016,48,neg,
agoda,Rooms are far from the main builiding making it a little UNFRIENDLY if you have small kids. Staff need to consider the guest' need first rather their 'SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY policy. We were give a room in a floor with no elevator access and far from the stairs even with knowledge that I am staying with a baby. After complaining they were able to address our needs. Ambiance was good and there were courteous staff all around.,Jun,02,2016,76,pos,
agoda,I love this hotel. The breakfast wasn't the best but pretty good. I enjoyed the waffles. The view at this hotel is amazing. We had lake side views and the fog would roll in right at us. It was very nice. The swimming pool was a relaxing break. The rooms and the cleanliness are good and like a 4 or 5 star hotel should be. The staff were all friendly and helpful.

Receptionist mentioned that the room is currently under renovation. Should not be included in the room choices. My son was also disappointed that the playroom is on-going renovation. They should have transferred it to a new room instead of shutting it down. They did that for the Gym and Game Room. Hotel should realize that Taal Vista  to many of us is a family hotel and children are definitely part of the family.,May,25,2016,88,pos,
agoda,Still the best hotel in tagaytay. Staff are very accomodating. The room is very clean and spacious. manage to book a queen size bed + single bed for 4 and adults.

agoda,The place was not that of a five star. Carts were lacking that we needed to carry our stuffs whereas we were there to be relaxed. Some crew were not trained to greet customers. The bed i booked was one king size and 1 single and yet we were given two singles- I paid for 8k. It took long before the housekeeper arrived to arrange our beds. Hope things will improve.

agoda,I had a wonderful time. Although I stayed for an overnight with my friend  it was worth it! Love the scenic! You must visit this hotel. Great staff! They're very accommodating. The Taal Vista hotel exceeded my expectations! I cannot wait to come back.:),Apr,25,2016,100,pos,
agoda,Great place. This hotel is historic  decent and classy  with prime location and great service. I would have tried many different places in Tagaytay but this would be my favourite. I highly recommend staying in a lake view suite for just a little bit more money. The cultural show of traditional dances on weekends are an awesome treat too especially for overseas tourists.,Apr,25,2016,84,pos,
agoda,Nice Staff and services,Apr,11,2016,72,pos,
agoda,The hotel rate is expensive and not at par with international standard. It is not worth the money I paid. It didn't meet my expectations. Food is lousy  bland and some of them served cold. Hotel is quite big and not vibrant. However  hotel location and Taal Lake view is nice.,Apr,11,2016,64,pos,
agoda,Perfect balcony view of Taal Volcano. No shuttle bus/car. Food was OK. We can hear noise in our room.,Apr,09,2016,84,pos,

agoda,Taal Vista is next to Sky Ranch where the highest perched Ferris wheel in the Philippines is located. It is also pretty close to establishments where you may buy things you may need  and to dining places if you want to eat outside of the hotel. Their view deck is one of the best  if not the best places in Tagaytay where you may enjoy the volcano within a lake Taal volcano.,Mar,31,2016,84,pos,

agoda,Towels need to be changed. They look old.Overall the stay is comfortable . Buffet Breakfast needs to have better choices for the price of the room. No view at all at the Mountain side wing. Ground flr is noisy better take higher flrs if on this wing. .,Mar,27,2016,76,neg,

agoda,The bathroom and room was dirty.. Behind the bathroom door and in the corners hair and dirt.. The tables in the room were dusty and not clean.. Very noisy all night and all day.. Made the reservation lake view and paid extra when I got there they said my room type didn't have such a view.. They have only one car to serve the hotel..,Mar,24,2016,52,neg,
agoda,"In the deluxe room, I made a reservation, but there was no bathtub in the deluxe room, no hot shower was hot and it was the worst.",Mar,23,2016,44,neg,
agoda,The view from the room is worth splurging on! It is the perfect place for a staycation. The location is good  it is also located beside Sky Ranch. The staff was friendly  especially the manager who went out of her way to assist us and accommodate our requests despite having numerous clients during our stay in December. Definitely a memorable stay. :),Mar,22,2016,80,pos,
agoda,Very good as usual. Whenever we stay in Tagaytay  it's always at Taal Vista. We've tried several other hotels but we keep coming back to this hotel.,Mar,16,2016,77,pos,
agoda,The stay at Taal was wonderful- we ate both dinner and breakfast in the hotel and both were delicious. The dining area overlooks the beautiful lake and the view is beautiful. We checked out at noon  left our luggage at the front dest  and went to Ta'al to hike up to the Volcano. We planned on going back to the hotel to collect our luggage and heading straight for the airport from there. We had no idea how dusty and dirty we would be after the hike  so we arrived back to the hotel in a state unfit for flying. The wait staff was extremely accommodating when we asked for a place we might be able to quickly shower before leaving for the airport. They let us use their Spa showers and provided us with towels  robes and slippers free of charge!! It was such a lifesaver and we were so incredibly appreciative! I cannot say enough about the incredible service at this beautiful hotel!,Mar,15,2016,90,pos,
agoda,Celebrated my dad's birthday here. They even provided woth a complimentary cake with greetings on it plus a candle to blow. Dad felt so loved. Thank you Taal Vista staffs! You are all amazing.,Mar,14,2016,100,pos,
agoda,Oh it was terrible when we taking our breakfast buffet.. asking for coffee 5 times we asked they served cold coffee but they put in a big cup instead of regular coffee cup   no small spoon for coffee.. no plates and glasses on the rack. They don't fill in the food container when its up pity for the late person taking there breakfast less choices. Please improve customer service,Mar,10,2016,40,neg,
agoda,Room was clean. Bed was great. But my stay could have been better if the pillows were soft. I hope Taal Vista will change their pillows. As a 5-star hotel  I am expecting a better pillows.,Mar,05,2016,87,pos,

agoda,The staff were all helpful and corteous and the view is great as expected. We got a room at the ridge view  The room is spacious but we were disappointed with the bed which was hard and there was a stuffy smell on the room and toilet. We were excited to try the spa as well but we feel that the service is lacking. The massage was good but they dont have an overall feel  they also dont have sauna and jacuzzi compared to getting an 800php massage from the spa.,Feb,26,2016,76,pos,
agoda,Really nice location,Feb,25,2016,70,pos,
agoda,Check in was a bit on the disappointing side. Booking was made mid-week  so it was not that busy for sure. Overnight trip was in celebration of an 8th year anniversary. Reserved the best (e.g. most expensive) room available and front desk wanted to provide one of the worse rooms (no view  bottom floor). To their credit  when questioned  they corrected  but why would I have to do that in the first place. Room itself was extremely basic. Aircon was leaking (it was just overnight so didn't even complain). closet doors were broken and off hinges. Property is nice and location is great for where I wanted to go (Antonios)  but wouldn't stay there again.,Feb,22,2016,56,neg,
agoda,It was a great  wonderful and relaxing stay with Taall Vista Hotel. Staff are very accommodating  courteous and helpful.,Feb,22,2016,100,pos,
agoda,Not that awesome hotel  but definitely the one you should go to when you plan to be in Tagaytay.,Feb,22,2016,84,pos,
agoda,We enjoyed staying in this hotel  and for sure we will come back again.,Feb,21,2016,93,pos,

agoda,Out Lake Side room had no view. TV had no USB slot to play movies. Breakfast was great. View from View Deck was great late afternoon to early evenings  mornings were too foggy  nothing to see. Rooms were clean  staff were very efficient and cordial.,Feb,15,2016,83,pos,
agoda,It was a nice place but it needs updating of rooms and amenities. They could have offered food selections native to the place.,Feb,15,2016,68,pos,
agoda,The noise next room to mine was extremely bad. you can hear every word they say and worse they were yelling at each other as if everyone was deaf. They also had their TV at a very loud level. The room we got had no noise absorber - we had a door in between. They slept late so we had to sleep laate as well and they woke up early - 5AM - and started making noise. Room 313 as poorly renovated for noise.,Feb,15,2016,63,neg,

agoda,Things that I like: -Accessible to the Skyranch -Good view of the Taal -Near a casino (even though I'm not a gambler) -Food was good  could add more options. -Great staff Things I didn't like: -Wifi in the room is BAD  in the lobby the connection is good. -Room looks old  well maintained but could add more features to compensate for the price. -Things are located far  so you tend to walk around more. For young people this is good but for older folks. -Not too accessible. If you have a private car-- great  if not :). Overall my stay was good  a bit pricey though so I expected more. I could get a lot more benefits staying at a hotel in Manila with that price. The buffet was good  doesn't have many options but the food is good. Should add more coffee stations to compensate with the crowd. The room looks old but well maintained. The AC was good or is it because the weather was cold  I don't know. More benefits for the room would do great. In this age  Wifi connectivity is a key  In our room It is very BAD. The complements in the room is a 3 in 1  I guess better than have nothing. The CR doesn't have a drain so If your a messy user water tends to gather  but with the great staff all is taken care of. The location is somewhat good  its near skyranch and has a good view of taal  so If you want to relax and recuperate its a good place to stay but you should watch out for the price :).,Feb,09,2016,70,pos,
agoda,The hotel is located in the great location. The view from our room was spectacular. Room is a bit too basic for what the money we paid for. Organic restaurant was superb in term of food quality and taste.,Feb,09,2016,56,pos,
agoda,Excellent stay  just a bit disappointed during check in took 1 1/2 to wait for the next available room  other guest who arrives late were able to checked in right away.,Feb,09,2016,33,neg,
agoda,It was wonderful  will be back for a family vacation,Feb,08,2016,80,pos,
agoda,We took a long weekend from Manila. The journey by road is around 2 hours. Check in and check out was effortless although they required a 4 000 peso deposit. The room we had was in the cliff wing with no view but I guess the more expensive rooms would have a stunning view. Unfortunately it rained for both of our days there so we were unable to take the boat trip to the volcanoes and hike up its side which is highly recommended. The food is excellent  the staff are obliging and friendly. All in all an excellent stay.,Feb,08,2016,88,pos,
agoda,Good environment and Fantastic scenery. The facilities are little bit old yet it is still good.,Feb,06,2016,88,pos,

agoda,The bed was not comfortable. Noise is not filtered and you can hear noise from the hallway and in next rooms. the room looks old as well.,Feb,02,2016,50,neg,
agoda,stay was fine  My thoughts are that it is a 4 star hotel  however we did not dine there except for breakfast.,Feb,02,2016,73,pos,
agoda,We had a good stay here. Everything was good. The rooms are very comfortable and the service was great. The food was good. It was the conclusion to a very active 2 1/2 week vacation for us and it was nice to be in such a comfortable place for the last few nights.,Jan,25,2016,87,pos,

agoda,So far my stay in Taal Vista hotel with my family is ok  except the Pool VERY VERY COLD even at 1100am Lunch time.,Jan,15,2016,73,pos,
agoda,We were greeted by a friendly staff upon our checkin. What we especially liked about our stay was the early checkin since we were attending a wedding in the afternoon and we had to be inside our hotel room early to prep. Also  we were in the center of the commercial area which made it easier for us to get to restos  coffee shops and the like. The room was also spacious enough for an extra bed which made our stay very comfortable. The interior of the room assigned to us was also very modern.,Jan,12,2016,83,pos,
agoda,what I like about this hotel is that they have a big area where you can relax and overlooking the taal volcano and lake. I recommend this to my friends,Jan,11,2016,77,pos,
agoda,Aside from a couple of glitches like the power going off in the middle of the night  the hotel was pretty nice.,Jan,10,2016,87,pos,
agoda,"Impression that it is neither possible nor impossible. It was a toilet that was dissatisfied. As the sound is heard, there is resistance as a Japanese, but for Westerners and Filipinos it is a no problem?",Jan,10,2016,60,neg,
agoda,We were actually checked in  in another hotel  for 2 nights  after the first night  we visited Taal Vista Hotel  we didn't have second thoughts  we went directly to the reception and booked for our second night  and after our second night  we booked our third night and enjoyed our stay.,Jan,10,2016,100,pos,
agoda,Staff were very accommodating.,Jan,07,2016,80,pos,
agoda,We have a great time staying in the hotel... I would recommend it to my friends!,Jan,07,2016,80,pos,
agoda,overall good  just a little pricey  and i hope all kids 7&below will still get to eat for free for breakfast with their parents. i have a 3&6 y/o kid and my 3 y/o only ate 1 pancake and hot choco. was not able to bring my 6/o along because we were told that we need to pay half the price which is almost P500. My 6.o also eats pancake and cereals only for breakfast. this would be best for a family. kids should eat free! aside from NYE  weve stayed at taal vista for x number of times. so i hope this suggestio will highly be taken inti consideration,Jan,06,2016,77,pos,
agoda,The resort location is truly amazing but the food quality and food service standards could be a lot better. Value for money  I did definitely not receive.,Jan,05,2016,77,pos,
agoda,"The location is good, the view from the hotel is superb. It is cheap compared to Manila.",Jan,04,2016,80,pos,
agoda,The breakfast buffet could be better but other than that there is nothing wrong to say about my stay. I love your gardens and the Weather was almost perfect. (. Weather is never perfect ). My family had a great time and we will surely be back!,Jan,03,2016,93,pos,

agoda,Improve water brand  change your beds and pillows to more comfortable ones!,Dec,31,2015,93,pos,
agoda,While Taal Vista has exceptional view and location  I suggest that Management must look into the details of its amenities and services. I notice that it uses substandard mineral water. Let us say that the quality of water is the same but the water bottle's packaging reflects the hotel's image. The plastic labeling is soft and comes off and the brand is known to be a cheap brand that we buy from street vendors. In addition  the hotel doesn't give priority to the comfort of its guests. The bed is not comfortable. It is so hard. The bed and the pillow have dust mites that caused my family and I to scratch our heads  neck a and backs throughout the night. Some members of my family stayed at another room and have the same feedback. I didn't get to sleep at night because of these. Hotel beds and pillows are of utmost importance as they are supposed to guarantee to guests that even if they are away from home  they would feel at home at your hotel. When I called for assistance to have the lamp checked  I had to follow up for someone to come after an hour.,Dec,31,2015,73,neg,
agoda,Great,Dec,31,2015,73,pos,
agoda,Good rest and location,Dec,30,2015,93,pos,
agoda,There were some inconveniences like..the bathroom has no door  the sliding door lock going out to the patio is not done properly  sound insulation also needs improvement since we can hear children running from the room above us.But in general  but our stay is quite ok.,Dec,30,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Our stay in Taal Vista Hotel was quite relaxing and refreshing  except for some room facilities and/or surroundings that need to be improved. Outside venues like at the lobby and breakfast area were just awesome. We've enjoyed listening to the Christmas carol and folk-song/classical singers at the lobby  and having our breakfast full of good/delicious food while watching the serenity of Taal lake. Thumbs up! Anyway  when it came to the room facilities  they're quite old already needing renovation. There isn't any bidet installed (5-star hotels normally have bidets) to the disappointment of bidet users. Sliding doors were stucked up  and shower heads were not that easy to control with sprayed water stream not quite comfortable or skin-friendly. The mountain side view surroundings were not well maintained as there were tall cogon grasses blocking the mountain view. Well  the staff are friendly  courteous and accommodating.,Dec,30,2015,73,pos,
agoda,Hotel is okey. It's the trip to the hotel where traffic was at its worst.,Dec,28,2015,73,pos,
agoda,Overall the hotel staff accommodation and facilities is very very good.,Dec,28,2015,93,pos,
agoda,My family expected the amenities and appearance of a 5-star hotel. Instead  we were shocked to see a room with dirty tiles  a weak aircon and furnishings and interiors worthy of an old apartment. we expected a simple but elegant filipiniana designed hotel. thank God for the view and the cool weather.,Dec,28,2015,67,pos,
agoda,It was ok pretty average nothing wow compared to our visit in 2009,Dec,28,2015,63,pos,

agoda,Third time here. Not a bargain but one of the nicer hotels in Tagaytay,Dec,20,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Check-in was very quick. Staff was generally helpful. Room had high ceilings  floor to ceiling windows  and a veranda overlooking the lake. Bed linens were very comfortable.,Dec,17,2015,87,pos,
agoda,Got a room overlooking the Taal volcano. Kinda long walk to the room location otherwise it's alright. Security is good. Food offered in the buffet is good as well.,Dec,13,2015,97,pos,
agoda,everything went well except when we checked in it took them (housekeeping) more than an hour just to set up the bed we are to attend a wedding at 4 pm and decided to stay in taal vista for convenience and at the same time  for relaxation we went there at 1:30pm confirmation at 1:52pm but got the room  few minutes after 3pm the check out procedure was okay  but they missed to see that we left an item inside the hotel room  but honest enough when we asked if we left anything inside.,Dec,08,2015,77,pos,
agoda,I thought it was horrible. We arrived 30mins before check in. Kids and wife were so excited. We were told the room would be ready in a few mins only to learn after 2 hours that it was not ready. Worst  nobody informed us. I had to do follow-up every 30mins. Wife was so angry but I was able to manage her anger. Rooms are overrated I guess. You're paying 8k for a superior room that is not carpeted (just tiles). Choice of food at the buffet breakfast is very limited. Anyway  the kids enjoyed the rides at skyranch - the only reason why we chose Taal Vista.,Dec,04,2015,53,neg,
agoda,Very relaxing especially after terrible 2-hour traffic starting from Nuvali Sta. Rosa up to Taal Vista. Would recommend to travel early morning especially on long weekends.,Dec,01,2015,90,pos,
agoda,The view was fantastic  plain and simple. The Skypark was off to the side so it never blocked the view of the lake. Room was very spacious  food from room service and breakfast buffet was delicious. Here's a tip: Don't be afraid to order from the kids menu for room service as the serving was for a regular adult. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Tagaytay!,Dec,01,2015,90,pos,
agoda,My stay was superb  imagine drinking coffee at the lobby while listening to old school Christmas songs by Tony Benet  Nat King Cole and the likes....Food is superb  although room service can still improve. There is this warm Christmassy feeling all over the hotel...will bring the family there this Christmas,Nov,30,2015,87,pos,

agoda,Good,Nov,08,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Our stay here was very nice especially since they gave us the best/highest room with the best view at a short notice. But I guess what they should add is having a set of utensils (spoon  fork  and/or knife) ready in the room. Other than that  I'll say that our overnight here was very satisfying and I believe it is still one of the best hotels in Tagaytay.,Nov,05,2015,83,pos,

agoda,Feel good and comfortable for staying,Nov,02,2015,90,pos,
agoda,Not that great a hotel  definitely not 5 star. The room was very basic and did not seem to be that clean. The concierge will only book you transport through the hotels Avis facility which is very overpriced. The bar shuts at 11 which isn't that great if you want to chill out after a long day. When we got to our room after dinner the bed and room was covered in ants  as it was midnight we didn't want to swap rooms so had to stick it out  we were bitten alive throughout the night. When we mentioned to the manager we were offered a late check out the next time we stayed as a goodwill gesture  this is not really acceptable. Breakfast in the morning was reasonable  good selection  service not that great though  have to keep asking for coffee refills etc which I have never experienced in a 5 star hotel before. The hotel is okay  but for what you pay I would expect allot better  especially as the hotel is outside of town so you are relatively limited to where you can go.,Nov,02,2015,53,neg,

agoda,It was a great experience staying in the hotel  very relaxing place because it is very spacious  clean  has friendly and accomodating staff  and the fresh Air that is therapeutic for me. If i want to be free from stressful environment its the best place to stay for a while.,Nov,01,2015,97,pos,
agoda,It was the best hotel we stayed in,Oct,31,2015,80,pos,
agoda,I visit Tagaytay often but rarely I get a chance to splurge in one of the luxury hotel that the place has to offer. I can say that if luxury/ pampering is your priority you can definitely choose this type of hotel. I get to stay in the Premier Lake king because I want to have a view of Taal lake. They also have a mountain wing rooms where the swimming pool is located. Breakfast is buffet style and I can say that the selection of food is quite okay. It is located in front of Casino Filipino and beside Sky Ranch. If you choose the Lake room areas  you can view the big ferris wheel in your private balcony and you hear the screaming people in the area. But you don't have to worry about the noise  once in your room you can't hear the screaming in the sky ranch area. If you don't have a private vehicle like me  there is a jeepney that pass by in the area ( Casino Highway) coming from Our Lady of Lourdes Church. I am recommending this hotel if you have a budget to splurge and get the Lake rooms.,Oct,28,2015,93,pos,
agoda,I'd definitely go back to this hotel and it's my preferred place to stay whenever I need to go to Tagaytay to attend events in Tagaytay.,Oct,27,2015,100,pos,
agoda,The staff was exceptional helpful. Edwin M. at the consierge desk went above and beyond is helping find transportation for a large group to go to matabungkay beach and finding a local jeweler to fix a piece of jewelry..Always get the lake view... visit mid week if your looking for the solitude..

agoda,The total experience should had been wonderful if the room was comfortable for us but my sons complaint of the aircondition unit was not functioning so we open the window  the toilet doesnt have badae and a bit small compare to other hotels. Good thing the breakfast was perfect  nice ambiance and accomodating staffs. If i will be ask to come again  my answer will be  no thank you.,Oct,23,2015,77,neg,

agoda,Nice view old furniture also bathroom need renovation. Nice swimming pool&garden.,Oct,14,2015,97,pos,
agoda,Bad! There were checkings made to the room 2 hrs after checking in. Knocking and even forcing open the door was done. There were 2 attempts. 2 hrs after  a phone call was received to check on guest  which after query was replied to it being standard. Hotel guests are supposed to have good  Undisturbed and well rested stay. Noise out in the hallways and even from the other nearby rooms fails the STC (sound transmission coefficient).,Oct,14,2015,87,neg,
agoda,it was good..they just can't serve coffee that afternoon because it was inoperative according to the attendant at the lobby. I think they should have spare brewer.,Oct,08,2015,83,neg,

agoda,The room was clean as to be expected in a 5 star hotel. I needed to obtain some simple medicine and the hotel even had a free clinic. This was a very enjoyable stay in a lovely location.,Sep,30,2015,80,pos,
agoda,I highly recommend taal vista. We have been going back since i was a kid. Sm did a very good job maintaining it. Staffs are very professional football,Sep,30,2015,100,pos,

agoda,good sleep but pricing for normal day should be more cheaper. nothing to enjoy in the hotel except the nice view.,Sep,14,2015,63,neg,
agoda,The hotel is over rated frt desk needs to be trained  on check out they ask me if i got something from the inroom bar told them no after that she called somebody to check the room why ask me in the first place if shes gonna ask somebody to check the waist of time,Sep,04,2015,30,neg,

agoda,Overall  the stay has been really wonderful. The place was great and its location is perfect. Their staff has been very helpful as well. Opportunities for improvement include the location of their garden rooms. The garden is quite not really a garden. Their restroom could also be improved a bit. Lastly  their fitness gym needs a significant improvement.,Aug,29,2015,93,pos,
agoda,Very nice place to unwind during holidays....,Aug,26,2015,43,pos,
agoda,Good! very relaxing... good for breakaway and unwind...,Aug,24,2015,93,pos,
agoda,It was good. Second time there.,Aug,24,2015,83,pos,
agoda,Great stay!,Aug,23,2015,90,pos,
agoda,We checked in at 4am by Sheena. She was wearing her gorgeous and welcoming smile that early. I explained to her that it was a last minute booking and I wasn't able to book the previous night. She gladly offered an early check in with a fee and discounted breakfast as well. That was a very nice gesture as she noticed that we were all tired from the long drive and wanted to rest. No bellman assisted us to our room which is actually located at the other end of the hotel overlooking the volcano. The room was clean and spacious. The high ceiling and the balcony made the call. However  the name written on the welcome card was wrong  maybe due to the early check in. Would actually expect some 5-star toilet amenities but it was a disappointment to see their own brand that doesn't lather much and not fragrant at all. Mouthwash would have been a good addition too. Buffet breakfast was excellent I must say. Good varieties of Filipino dishes too. Staff at Cafe Veranda were all smiling and always willing to assist. Someone even helped me bring my plate on the table. Highly recommended.,Aug,23,2015,90,pos,
agoda,Very Good,Aug,21,2015,80,pos,
agoda,WE had another good stay and Taal Vista Hotel. We find the restaurant  like a lot of other hotels  expensive with average food. Lots of great restaurants outside in town along the main road. The room this time looked like it needed refurbishing. An ok hotel to stay at.,Aug,19,2015,73,pos,
agoda,Very relax  easy stay,Aug,19,2015,80,pos,
agoda,The hotel has excellent can do staff and management  the lounges and restaurant areas are beautifully decorated and there is a peaceful ambiance throughout. It is a true escape from the usual hustle bustle of any township or city and traffic in the Philippines affording real isolation and relaxation. Yet the hotel is only a few short km to Olivarez and 30 minutes from the departure points for a trip on the lake and to Taal Volcano. Rooms were very comfortable. Its a great hotel and environment but be warned  the room rate is expensive: AU $350 - $450 per night  more if you want a balcony view. There was a Agoda promo running for $170 / night and we stayed there 4 nights. It was on this stay we became engaged. A worthy hotel of five stars.,Aug,16,2015,97,pos,
agoda,ok. not bad,Aug,14,2015,93,pos,
agoda,Our stay was wonderful.,Aug,12,2015,63,pos,
agoda,We only stayed two nites and by nature am hard to please so me giving this hotel a 5 star says a lot about their hotel .lot of hotels claim to be a 4or5 star but don't live up to it this one does,Aug,02,2015,83,pos,
agoda,Good ! Not great !,Jul,30,2015,73,neg,
agoda,Great service between the hotel staff and the restaurant. The rooms were so-so. Stayed in the new wing. We saw bugs on more than one occasion. Also  the shower head needs to be replaced in room 460. It's clogged so only half of it is working.,Jul,29,2015,77,neg,

agoda,Good Food and Value for Money!,Jul,20,2015,80,pos,
agoda,We had a fantastic stay here. We need not go somewhere else. Place was awesome and clean. Staffs are very polite and helpful. 1. Cygnal cable was always out of signal. 2. At the reception  when i asked if we can have the room with a nice view. They didnt inform me beforehand how much it would cost. They just went ahead and prepared the upgrade and i didnt have the chance to backout. But  all in all. T'was a relaxing stay. TYVM .,Jul,18,2015,87,pos,
agoda,Since I was a kid I go to this place I like going to this place however when I went this time everything was alright but when I was about to sleep I found a bag of rock salt under the sheets. I complained and everything alright after that,Jul,16,2015,70,pos,
agoda,Awesome,Jul,16,2015,87,pos,
agoda,excellent weekend stay. will definitely go back.,Jul,14,2015,93,pos,
agoda,without a word  was given a handicap room. you can tell from the bathroom configuration...shower curtain instead of real shower screen/door  hand rails everywhere including a vertical pole 2 feet in front of toilet bowl! the layout did not allow a vanity top so we had to stack our toiletries precariously on the water closet. We know we had a handicap room because we peeped into our neighbours' rooms and they looked normal. Breakfast was a dissapointment too. I've enjoyed much better quality and selection in 3 star hotels. We decided to skip breakfast after 1 morning. This hotel probably sells for its view only. But if you dont get a room with a view  try somewhere else.,Jul,13,2015,33,neg,
agoda,As what I say.... Great hotel. Very good place and location. Beautiful view. Nice and attentive staff. Delicious food. Very comfortable to stay. Nothing I can say... It's a great hotel.. Fantastic! Come back again,Jul,03,2015,77,pos,
agoda,N/A,Jul,02,2015,90,,
agoda,Comfortable but again they need to improve the food quality (breakfast)  attentiveness of their staff (front desk/restaurant)  quality of their elevators and other infrastructures.,Jun,30,2015,100,neg,
agoda,Stayed overnight at two deluxe rooms with my husband and kids to celebrate our anniversary and father's day. Check in was swift and efficient. Staff very helpful. Rooms were clean and well-stocked. Housekeeping ready to resupply the room with additional towels and toiletries. Had breakfast at Cafe Veranda. Selection was great and even if the hotel was full  we didn't have to wait for a table for a long time. Lots of activities at the hotel like bubbles at the view deck  swimming. The lifeguard at the pool area was especially helpful to guests. The hotel location can't be beat. Close to the numerous restaurants in Tagaytay City should you prefer to dine outside the hotel. And it's right beside Sky Ranch so best hotel to stay at for those with children. Will definitely be back!,Jun,28,2015,43,pos,

agoda,Very good experience that's why I return back to the same hotel,Jun,15,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Their swimming is too small for that big of a hotel. Furthermore  the taste of their brewed coffee is too bland  not a five star material. But by the end of the day  it is still one of the best in tagaytay.,Jun,15,2015,90,pos,
agoda,Please put seat bidet or hand bidet in the watercloset for hygienic purposes.,Jun,15,2015,87,neg,
agoda,Was alright! Relaxed and rejuvenating. First and foremost staying on the ridge overlooking the taal was brilliant... just a few things I think the hotel can do better is to have a better spread for breakfast for vegetarians  pay attention to droplets leaking from the aircon inside the room and few staff during breakfast who didnt do a good job in taking our requests to completion. Else rest was pleasant as an experience,Jun,15,2015,83,pos,

agoda,I set the bar real low so I won't be disappointed.,Jun,02,2015,80,neg,
agoda,There were enough amenities for everyone in the family to enjoy. The rooms were a bit old but the hot water in the shower was good and their food was  too.,Jun,02,2015,63,pos,
agoda,Second stay at Taal Vista and good again. Big hotel so can become crowded at times. Breakfast was a bit crazy as so many people all helping themselves at the same time. Really need to extend the restaurant or build another restaurant to fit everyone in.,Jun,01,2015,80,pos,
agoda,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Only issue is room is somehow not noise proof as you can hear people talking on walkways near the rooms. Very nice view of Taal and the location is located strategically near tour establishments. Very huge room with complete amenities.,Jun,01,2015,80,pos,
agoda,It was good.front desk employee excellent service. When someone check our to they did not fix our bed.,Jun,01,2015,87,pos,
agoda,My family enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We were able to do a lot of kid-friendly activities inside & outside the hotel. The staff were very attentive and accomodating. I just wanted to ask the management if they could have the pool heated during the cool season from Dec-Feb.,May,30,2015,67,pos,
agoda,It was perfect. My birthday celebration with my family was worthy. We enjoyed everything  the view of the taal was relaxing  the kids corner made my sons experience fantastic. The food was great! Very happy with our stay.,May,28,2015,97,pos,
agoda,Room and staff are nice. Overlooking of taal volcano and garden is nice to relax. It's so calm and quiet.,May,24,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Our room was located in the mountain view  however  we dont have a view of the mountain  nevertheless  we were able to see the taal lake in the morning we had our breakfast  food was great. Pool was great as well  problem is its close around 8 pm..,May,14,2015,80,pos,
agoda,Awesome as always! I make sure I stay a couple of weekends every year at this hotel. Very private and does not feel cramped even during special occasions.,May,14,2015,87,pos,
agoda,We stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights. Has great view of the Taal lake. Good location  walking distance from the Sky Ranch if you want to go there. Staff is very accommodating. Hotel room is cozy. Breakfast buffet was a let down  didn't have much variety. Tried the Taza Fresh Table restaurant  food was just ok given the high ratings and good reviews from bloggers. I like the hotel but it doesn't have the wow factor of a 5 star hotel..,May,13,2015,77,pos,
agoda,Taal Vista has always been a favorite of ours whenever we visit Tagaytay. The rooms at their Lake Wing were new and good. Food is OK but I found their menu a bit limited  so the buffet could be recommended. The staff are amazing though. They immediately attend to the needs of the guests.,May,12,2015,97,pos,

agoda,Buffet breakfast lacks variety,Apr,25,2015,67,neg,
agoda,Taal Vista Hotel is perfect for families with young kids along with the older family members. I love that they provided free wheelchair to my grandmother the whole duration of our stay. Wide-Open spaces with amazing view of Taal volcano (other side has view of the mountains which is also just as breath-taking).,Apr,18,2015,100,pos,
agoda,As always  once you checked in  the last thing on your mind is to check out. Relaxing and comforting.,Apr,16,2015,90,pos,
agoda,It was a great stay. My family and I enjoyed the swimming pool  the buffet breakfast. It is accessible . Waling distance to the ranch  the casino and few minutes drives to mahogany market. Staff members are accomodating and helpful. Will definitely stay again in this hotel.,Apr,10,2015,97,pos,
agoda,Great!,Apr,08,2015,80,pos,
agoda,My wife and I stayed at the Taal Vista over the Easter week end and had a delightful stay. The staff are courteous and friendly  the food was good  and the rooms spacious and comfortable.The hotel itself is quite sprawling so easy to get lost until you know your way around. The view is outstanding  just pray for good weather so you get to enjoy it at it's best. The only negative I will mention is that the rooms were overpriced. Perhaps they were just cashing in on Easter  but we paid roughly double what we would normally pay for a hotel of this standard  Easter weekend notwithstanding. I would rate the hotel as 4 star  not 5 star. But all in all  a very enjoyable weekend.,Apr,06,2015,90,pos,

agoda,We checked in at 11pm  only 1 staff was in the front desk. After 10 minutes  he called help fr another who was just inside the room adjacent to the front desk  seemingly chatting with another staff. And for a very nice hotel  the staff seem very lax and would talk loud and laugh loud. I think that's an area of improvement,Apr,04,2015,77,neg,
agoda,Very good,Apr,03,2015,100,pos,
agoda,Great but the only thing I saw for a five star is some old and very unprofessional repairs to fixtures tiles in the elevator cracked and broken,Apr,03,2015,87,pos,

agoda,This is the 2nd time we stayed here and we always enjoy staying here because of the location and the music lounge with singer and pianist so relaxing and also the dessert cupcakes and cakes but some staff should trained well in assisting there clients properly but the rest of the staff is OK :),Mar,31,2015,67,pos,

agoda,It was great!,Mar,30,2015,80,pos,
agoda,The last time I stayed in this hotel was back in the 90's and from what I remember the new management had improved the hotel quite a lot in terms of dining facilities and facilities. I believe some rooms were already renovated  but we were assigned in one of the older wings hence it was obvious that the room (although quite clean) was rundown already and overdue for an upgrade. We had dinner in the hotel but the food was so-so  to think they had an event for visiting chefs. Breakfast was bountiful but nothing really special. Given the price vs. competition in the area  I expected more in general.,Mar,30,2015,87,neg,

agoda,Kids enjoyed and want to go back,Mar,19,2015,87,pos,
agoda,Our stay in Taal vista was good as usual. Although we had a problem with lunch where in when we arrived  the restaurant was all reserved and the only place we went to was the lobby lounge where they didnt serve full meals. However  our stay was great and the rooms were nice. Taal vista will always be one of my favorite places to stay in Tagaytay.,Mar,17,2015,100,pos,
agoda,it was amazing. The staff is very helpful & friendly. The breakfast is good. The view & the weather is perfect for celebrating your anniversary.,Mar,17,2015,83,pos,

agoda,it was a very relaxing stay and was able to enjoy it with the family. thank you,Mar,09,2015,100,pos,
agoda,We wanted to have 2 rooms with king beds  but one of them with an additional bed. Front desk had to give us 4 different rooms until they accomplished such simple request. Later on  we had to complain because they room with an additional bed had only a bed  but not extra toiletries  slippers  breakfast  etc. In general  it was a pleasant stay  but the front desk clearly could be a much better job understanding the customer requests and checking that everything is done correctly.,Mar,06,2015,80,neg,
agoda,Love the food  the views and the staffs...but so costly!!!,Mar,04,2015,70,neg,

agoda,It was a pleasant weekend  a bit rainy but we sure have a long rest away from busy city and with a nice view.,Feb,19,2015,70,pos,
agoda,We checked in  and our driver left. We then found out we were staying in a different wing so had to get our driver back. The room was plain and featureless  and it smelled of cigarette smoke. When you compare this with 5 star hotels in Manila  it doesn't match. 4 star  maximum. The menu was very limited. Fairly dull. And they delivered the cold toast in the morning with no butter. Sorry  but that's not 5 star standard. And it was expensive for what it was. We will not be back.,Feb,18,2015,80,neg,
agoda,good,Feb,15,2015,73,pos,
agoda,Location is good  But anything managed by SM is cheap. Even free items in the room  such as soap and toothbrush you have to call 3-4 times for them to bring. Food very good and low quality. Rooms worth 2000 pesos only. In general what you see at SM you see in this hotel,Feb,14,2015,57,neg,
agoda,Very nice,Feb,12,2015,97,pos,
agoda,I have been in Tall Vista Hotel many times but mostly for our business conferences. But this time i went (as a couple) in order to relax and just re-ignite. And that we did - being beautiful with the view overlooking Taal Volcano and knowing that its dormant but not extinct. I guess seeing nature in its verdant form gave us also an inner glimpse of our barest souls.,Feb,10,2015,80,pos,

agoda,We have a fine stay  although the beds are quite small and the room given to us has no view as it is the outermost room on the mountain wing  its comfort room has no lock and the wooden post in it shows that it is old merely retrofitted. Room 334. Nevertheless  I enjoyed the classical music and wine at the Lobby Lounge which also had a fireplace. We were also able to jog in t3 sky view deck during the early which is eindy & considerably cool.,Jan,08,2015,70,neg,

agoda,If you are coming to Tagaytay for the view - this is the perfect place. The lake is stunning  and the view from the deck is amazing of the volcano and surrounding area. The hotel is right next to an amusement park - a bit of a wild place  but fun for the family. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and bar area  and the pool is cute and nice. Our room had dirty floors  the tub was not great  mirrors had not been cleaned in a long time  and overall  not 5 stay quality. The lobby is 5 star while the room is much closer to a 2 star room. Our dinner was pretty bad and while we did enjoy most of the breakfast food  the plates and trays at the buffet were often empty for long periods of time. The dining room was chaos during breakfast - more staff and more efficient staff are needed. My advice would be to find a small hotel in the area and get a more intimate experience and skip the Taal Vista.,Dec,23,2014,60,neg,

agoda,Great taal lake view,Dec,19,2014,93,pos,
agoda,The stay was very satisfying. There were occasions though when other guests tend to forget that there were other guests staying in the hotel. Our first night was almost a fiasco with guests staying right above our room constantly trampling around their room. This was remedied though with prompt response to our request for change of room. In the new room though  defects continued to hound us with a dripping aircondition and a safe with weak batteries. The response to these complaints were prompt and remedies done were satisfactory. Then on our penultimate day  cleaning was haphazardly done with coffee mugs left unwashed and floor left improperly mopped.,Dec,18,2014,80,neg,
agoda,The deluxe rooms have ceramic floor tiles that give it a cheap feel. Toilet furnishings are minimal and budget hotel standard  but they price themselves 5 stars. Breakfast buffet spread limited  and the staff are too busy to clear tables to provide service standards expected from a 5 star hotel. Kids play room is a pathetic little room with minimal toys or books. Nothing here is near 4 star let alone 5 stars,Dec,18,2014,80,neg,
agoda,Had a lovely  will definitely return,Dec,14,2014,87,pos,
agoda,The location and view from the premier lake room can't be beat. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Spa is good though expensive. However  condition  cleanliness and food choices need to be upgraded.,Dec,14,2014,80,neg,

agoda,Excellent! Would definitely come back.,Dec,11,2014,100,pos,
agoda,Although they rate themselves as 5 star we feel they are overrating themselves knowing that most of their facilities are outdated. The price is too high for everything they offer.,Dec,11,2014,100,neg,
agoda,Excellent,Dec,09,2014,83,pos,
agoda,The staff is great they are very friendly and very hospitable. We have also tried the spa which I recomend. We had I good experience with it. Plus the food is another great experience. Overall I recommend this hotel.,Dec,08,2014,100,pos,
agoda,average and was disappointed as our first day and at 7am was woken-up by a loud music playing outside garden with no consiseration to their guests still asleep. Complained to the front desk but nothing happened not even apology.. Overall will not stay again,Dec,05,2014,37,neg,
agoda,"Taal Vista is a hotel with a lot of history. The location is unique and the pictures and history are fascinating to read. The view is brilliant, but you do not have to stay in the hotel. Our room was upgraded room had noppes view, and work going on. The pool is a swimming pool, nothing special. Breakfast is a habit. The lobby is stylish and classic. Beautiful view for coffee with piece of cake. The complete massage in the spa was very nice. It smelled a bit muffy in the room, but in the evening it's lovely to sit outside in the coolness. But that can be anywhere else too. Personally, I would like to have a drink or a drink with a view of Language Volcano. Overnight stays can be better done for the money. But for a night it was good to do it. There are many conferences and meetings in the hotel VAT.",Dec,04,2014,70,pos,
agoda,The room we got is old and a long walk from the lobby  restaurant  and parking area! Walk  walk  walk!,Dec,04,2014,80,neg,
agoda,it was ok  what was disappointing though was that i booked two rooms and we were assigned to 2 different floors. front office management should anticipate the needs of families.,Dec,02,2014,80,neg,
agoda,Comfortable and relaxed,Dec,02,2014,73,pos,
agoda,The room was spacious and comfortable. I would have wished that the door would offer more privacy since i can hear footsteps and noise coming from the corridor. Also  pls install bidet in all your water closets. Much thanks for the warm service.,Dec,01,2014,100,neg,
agoda,I expected too high  so was disappointed. Staff not very efficient. Food was too sweet for my taste. Does not seem to be worth the money.,Nov,29,2014,83,neg,

agoda,Lovely  cool stay at the Batangas suite and premier rooms for our family of 6. Parking was big and generous  same as lobby and sitting areas. Reception  porter and waiters were so attentive to our needs. Even at the breakfast room  plates were cleared swiftly. The simple furnishings of the place does not overshadow the hotel's biggest selling point  the VIEW. No amount of expensive or grand adornment can rival what it naturally has. Just one minor suggestion  we hope reception guides where to park depending on room location considering its such a long building and has 2 lobbies and underground parking. People with walking problems have to alight near their rooms.,Nov,23,2014,90,pos,
agoda,Short but pleasant stay at the hotel. The airconditioning unit could use some improvement though and the luggage service took a while as we were checking out but the very helpful bellboy made up for it anyway.,Nov,22,2014,97,pos,
agoda,We stayed in an old wing. Far from lobby. Main complaint was that walls were paper thin. Could here the people in the room next to me watching TV at 1am!,Nov,20,2014,67,neg,

agoda,Had a good stay but this hotel is in need of an upgrade. Our room had a gross stain on the main light shade in the room. I had to cover it with a towel so I didnt have to see it while in the room. Breakfast is just ok. Many of the hot items are not so hot. Nobody likes cold waffles  pancakes  or bacon. I found it odd that the toilet had no spray washer for all the local filipinos. Maybe a little overpriced.,Nov,07,2014,53,neg,
agoda,We tried the promo online that's why we got the Mountain View room. We didn't expect it to be that old and it seems that it was not well-maintained. The bathroom looks old and the smell was not so good. We also didn't like the furnishings. It's like we're not in Taal Vista at all.,Nov,07,2014,60,neg,

agoda,I am requesting a refund from the manager. For two nights we have stayed we have experienced noise coming from the ceiling which we believe that was caused by rats. But since I purchased the booking from agoda they said cant refund  and would take by 4 weeks to process from agoda. It is a bad experience waste of time  could have spent it somewhere else.,Oct,31,2014,47,neg,

agoda,Very good stay  travel arrangements perfect  pool water was very cold. Breakfast was very good  staff cute and friendly  we would stay there again  restaurant staff arranged a perfect engagement dinner  thank you,Oct,17,2014,97,pos,
agoda,Best part is the view. Hotel is located at the top of the road down to the Taal Boat ride docks and beaches  bisects the main road that connects all life in Tagaytay. Close enough  but also far enough away from the crowds at Summit Ridge and the second roundabout. Buffet breakfast was good  but room is crowded/noisy when busy. Dinner on Friday nights is expensive but best in town. Rooms remodeled still have a classic feel  though the remodeling is still ongoing. Covered walkway connecting the main building and the mountain wing is gone  so when it rains  one cannot walk without an umbrella even within the hotel. Example: walking to dinner or wedding - going to get a little bit wet unless you have an umbrella  and you will have to carry the umbrella around with you - no umbrella stand. In the room: no clothes hangers on closet left side makes it unusable. No robes in room  just slippers. Noise passes easily through the adjacent room doors; easily fixed with some soundproofing. Passed these notes to the GM  and we will see on our next stay at Taal Vista next year.,Oct,14,2014,93,neg,

agoda,During our stay at the hotel  we have a relaxing moments because of the wonders of the cultural heritage while we enjoy a sumptuous lunch. The Dance Group delighted us as they perform beautifully their choreographed cultural presentations. We also visit The Kultura Butik that sells Filipino gift and souvenir items. We enjoyed the amazing scenery from the View Deck. We also enjoyed watching and hearing piano music and the scheduled group singer at night at the hotel lobby.,Oct,08,2014,83,pos,

agoda,Location and view are very overwhelming  very good to see the taal volcano. The staff are nice and helpful.

agoda,It was one of the best tagaytay experience ever! So relaxing that I dont want to go back to work anymore. Lol but the massage service is extremely expensive. 6k pesos for 2pax  that's supposed to be another night stay already lol but t'was our choice  we were too lazy to go out of the hotel. That was the most expensive body massage we've ever had. Haha p.s you can have a body massage in tagaytay cheapest for 600 pesos for 2pax only.,Aug,21,2014,93,neg,
agoda,It is a great hotel for a weekend away from Manila. Everything was positive with only one complaint. The main attraction nearby is Taal volcano and the hotel no longer organises trips to visit the volcano. They also (probably for legal reasons) cannot offer advice about how to do it. So we walked across the street to the McDonalds and found a tout who set things up for us. As the volcano is the main attraction the hotel should either offer tours or provide advice about how to book a tour. To do neither is  in my opinion  a real problem.,Aug,16,2014,97,neg,
agoda,breakfast was not good  it was pricey,Aug,06,2014,93,neg,

agoda,This is a very nice hotel and definately price-quality superb  although the breakfast is very shameful  not much variety and poorly prepared  the juices tast artificial  the bacon is so crunchy it just breaks in pieces and does not have tast pancakes and waffles are already prepared hours before and or now spongy so many staff wandering around   but still we have to call them to ask for coffee or tea  many flies in the breakfast area. But once again the rooms are their money more then worthed!! Just take your breakfast outside in as example 'Skyranch' just 100m down the road.,Jul,27,2014,80,neg,

agoda,Taal Vista is rather pricey  and you get the same nice amenities that is expected from a hotel in this price range. What makes Taal Vista special for me is the service that you get from EVERYONE -- the bell boy who helped me carry my stuff even before I entered the lobby  the front desk personnel  the receptionist at the breakfast restaurant  all the waiters. It's a pity that I failed to get even a single name. I will next time  because I'll surely be back  probably for the December holidays.,Jun,11,2014,87,pos,

agoda,If you are staying at Taal Vista for a wedding or conference then it will probably suit you perfectly. However  we were there for the weekend to explore the local area and found the hotel to be extremely bland. The main problem however  was the same that many visitors have mentioned - I booked a Deluxe Lake Room and was given a room with no balcony and no view of the lake. The reception staff explained that most of the Deluxe rooms and all of the Superior rooms have no or only a partial view of the lake. You would expect all rooms in a hotel called Taal Vista to have a vista of Taal Lake! We were shown alternative rooms and were finally given one of only 5 ground floor rooms that have a view. If you are visiting this hotel because of the view - which is spectacular  particularly at sunrise and sunset - be very clear when booking that you want a room with a view.,Jun,03,2014,63,neg,
agoda,A great bonding time with the family  greatfood and friendly staff.,Jun,03,2014,93,pos,
agoda,As usual  we had a great stay in the hotel. The only thing about it that's bothersome is its lack of bidet in the toilet.,Jun,03,2014,90,neg,
agoda,We arrived at about 5pm. Very quick check in no hassles. But we preferred the new wing. The old wing has old carpet  old furnishings. The last time we were there we changed room coz the faucet was leaking. Dinner was good and the waiters were nice and polite. Buffet breakfast was great with assorted choices. But one has to come early because the main dining area is packed.The waiters were friendly to serve us drinks because we were seated far from the breakfast tables. Check out was fast.I love Taal Vista Hotel.,Jun,02,2014,80,pos,

agoda,Simply Superbbbb!!!,May,27,2014,93,pos,
agoda,Amazing and family friendly hotel. Gym is bad but u will spend most of ur time outdoors,May,27,2014,97,pos,
agoda,Very pleasant stay.,May,23,2014,87,pos,
agoda,it was nice and relaxing with a bit of inconveniences. pool and spa are located only on one side of of the complex. our room was on the other side so we have to walk a bit far before we can use the pool and go to the spa. should have a wider variety of food choices at the restaurant.,May,23,2014,77,neg,
agoda,The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Room is big and nicely arranged. You can actually spend a few days just within the hotel because of its great location and excellent amenities. Lobby area is very nice. Food is excellent as well. Centrally located and accessible to main attractions in the area.,May,20,2014,90,pos,
agoda,You should definitely try staying at Taal Vista if you want to have that luxurious feel of a hotel while not feeling overwhelmed. The proximity of the hotel to establishments also made it easier for us (Mushroom Burger  Bulalo Point  Sky Ranch  and more). The exclusive view from the gardens/terraces of the Hotel on the Taal Lake and Volcano made our stay really worthwhile. It would even slip on your mind to not leave the hotel because everything is already there.,May,18,2014,90,pos,
agoda,Had a great 1 night stay  we like how the room and bathroom are clean which made our stay a pleasant one.,May,18,2014,87,pos,
agoda,Our stay was great and very convenient to walk near Sky Ranch,May,18,2014,83,pos,
agoda,Rooms are clean  location is quiet  unfortunately wasn't able to get a lake view room. Wished the toilets had bedets. Overall I would recommend for couples and small families alike.,May,16,2014,77,neg,
agoda,Taal Vista Hotel is one of my favorite hotels in the Philippines. Great service  friendly staff  and great ambiance. However  the room I got this time around needed some fixtures especially in thw bathroom area but overall  I enjoyed my stay as expected. Keep it up! (And don't overlook the small things as I know Taal Vista has great attention to detail),May,15,2014,83,pos,
agoda,It was nice. We will go back and stay at the same hotel anytime. Quiet  calming and relaxing experience.,May,13,2014,77,pos,
agoda,That was one of the most unforgettable weekend treat for my mother who is 74yrs old now. It is very accessible to the places she always wanted to go ro in Tagaytay. We will definitely go back here.,May,12,2014,93,pos,
agoda,in general it was good  i enjoy the nice view  nice surronding nice breakfast nice stuff.,May,11,2014,83,pos,
agoda,Best place to go when you just decided to stay away from the stress in Manila. Good food  nice view  clean rooms and polite employees.,May,09,2014,100,pos,
agoda,We arrived three hours early of check- in schedule but front desk personnel were very accommodating. Lobby staff were also friendly and helpful. Its quite hot outside but we enjoyed going around the hotel. Spacious room  clean bathroom and nice view from window. We would stay here again soon.,May,09,2014,100,pos,
agoda,excellent!,May,07,2014,90,pos,
agoda,I spent there my holy week with my family and we enjoyed the very nice view of Taal lake. They are very centrally located and just beside sky ranch where kids love to visit once again. They only was a bit disappointed since the pool is quite small but nevertheless the lifeguard was very warm  friendly and accommodating. He even extended extra hours so kids had a great time to bond with their cousins. Definitely would be coming back again.,May,03,2014,80,pos,
agoda,It was our first time to stay in Taal Vista with our 3-year old child. I would like to commend the staff for being so friendly and accomodating. The amenities were very good. My only comment was that the noise from the room beside us was very audible and we could clearly hear what the occupants there were talking about. Other than that  this hotel is still very good and I will book a room here again on our next Tagaytay visit.,May,02,2014,80,pos,
agoda,I had a wonderful stay with my friends. It was fun to just chill.Great and comfy room. A great plus for the awesome breakfast and the large area to walk around and stay. Also  other restaurants were not so far  though not quite walkable either. All in all  this is a great place to just chill and have fun.,Apr,28,2014,73,pos,
agoda,I hope the hotel would renovate their rooms. They're very clean but the designs are so outdated.,Apr,28,2014,93,neg,
agoda,still the best hotel in the area,Apr,27,2014,77,pos,
agoda,good price. great staff performance -- still remembers me from the last time i stayed and accomodated special requests. great view of taal from the cafe,Apr,25,2014,77,pos,
agoda,I would defeinitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. The breakfast was great. And the hotel was very clean. My son went to the kids activity room. We enjoyed our stay.. :),Apr,23,2014,83,pos,
agoda,great and enjoyable.,Apr,23,2014,90,pos,
agoda,nice  relaxing!,Apr,23,2014,90,pos,
agoda,its good and nice... but GAAAD! the price are sooo much.. u pay 1500 pesos for their regular massage... :( but the stay was nice for two days,Apr,21,2014,80,pos,
agoda,It was a very relaxing stay. Fast check in & check out. Very accommodating & friendly staff. I just wish the pool was warm. It was cold because of the weather.,Apr,17,2014,77,pos,
agoda,Our stay in Taal Vista was ok  but not good enough for the money we paid. It is centrally located in Tagaytay and has ample parking. Points of criticism: - Room was not cleaned or maintained properly. Shower door would not open fully  and was filthy underneath. Shower aircon and toilet very noisy. - Wifi is very spotty  though free - The parking management is very inconvenient - guests have to get their entry ticket stamped each time (instead of just presenting the room key  for example). - Bar closes early - 11pm on weekends! Overall  I would not recommend spending a lot of money on rooms in this hotel. Next time  we shall look one with better value-for-money.,Apr,16,2014,80,neg,
agoda,it was fun and exciting,Apr,16,2014,73,pos,
agoda,VERY GOOD,Apr,16,2014,63,pos,

agoda,Suberb and got a chance to bond with family on a nice weather.,Apr,13,2014,73,pos,
agoda,I've been to the Taal Vista Hotel as a kid but never stayed there. It has always been a landmark and this time the opportunity presented itself so we stayed there for 2 nights. Though we did not spend much time at the hotel you can tell that it has been completely overhauled and renovated to get it's charm back from yesteryear. What we enjoyed most apart from the clean rooms of course  was sitting on the terrace and having breakfast. Most Filipinos shy away from the sun and sit indoors in aircon but we made most of the view and enjoyed our breakfast buffet out on the terrace overlooking the Taal Volcano - bliss!,Apr,10,2014,93,pos,
agoda,there is a great view to see taal volcano from our room although it is on the 1st floor  we enjoyed in their garden and pool. the double room is clean and wide  the internet connection is outstanding,Apr,08,2014,77,pos,
agoda,Relaxing- tried their spa and it was a great experience Good location- offers good view of the taal volcano  near the new amusement park (sky ranch)and restaurants (krispy kreme  leslie's  mushroom burger  Mcdo just right across  etc) Spacious room with floor to ceiling window Comfortable large bed good for family with small kid Attentive staff Deluxe room is far from the pool area,Apr,08,2014,80,pos,
agoda,It's a top hotel  but like all top hotels in Tagatay  it's expensive. It's palacial - huge. With long corridors and a clinical design  it's reminiscent of a big hospital or government building in the room wings. Paying extra for a Lake Wing room  I was expecting a view of the lake/volcano  but the room faced the main road and I had to be extra again  for a lake view. Otherwise  everything was fine.,Apr,08,2014,70,neg,
agoda,My sister and I on separate incident was locked in the elevator for good 2 to 3 minutes according to the staff when they reviewed cctv. The person who answered the emergency call that I made from the elevator has NO idea that there are people that has claustrophobia who can go crazy when confined in a very tight space such as the hotel elevator and when they finally let me out  the two men was just looking at me and the only thing that they asked me was my room number. I was freaking out. I had to take valium to ride the plane. They should send the front desk and the emergency responders to a customer service class to learn how to talk to people,Apr,07,2014,70,neg,
agoda,I paid a lot of money for a room with a view of the lake and volcano. When i checked in i found out i didnt have this and had to pay EXTRA to upgrade. I did this as the whole reason for choosing this hotel was for the view...!!!,Mar,30,2014,40,neg,
agoda,The room was comfortable  clean  but not luxurious. Internet access was spotty. Staff was a mixture of very attentive to somewhat attentive (in restaurant). If you stay here  pay the extra charge to have a room facing Taal lake  hotel has a spectacular vantage point for lake and volcano views. Hotel offers an excellent array of spa  food  transportation  and related services. Weakest aspect of hotel is the restaurant. Staff are not attentive  and the food is mediocre. While they offer an international menu  the cooks are clearly not familiar with how to prepare dishes like the schnitzel which was deep fried and to dry in was difficult to cut.,Mar,28,2014,67,neg,
agoda,The Hotel is old & needs renovation. The staff is unhelpful. Like the location and proximity to attractions.,Mar,27,2014,60,neg,
agoda,Not very good. Reception was careless - did not even give an orientation on rooms and other amenities. Room was not ready  amenities were missing.,Mar,26,2014,63,neg,
agoda,Not good  very poor service and sanitary. Checking out took a long time. A mouse was roaming inside our room,Mar,24,2014,53,neg,
agoda,The breakfast is good  however the service is bad  we got locked out in our room  our key card was not working and took time for them to attend to us because there was no service phone available in our area.. Luckily I have saved the reception number on my cellphone. As we were waiting to check out and waiting for the room service there was a mouse that ran inside our room.. I did not expect the kind of service taal vista is giving knowing it is owned already by a big company and the price that we paid for.,Mar,24,2014,53,neg,
agoda,actually it was my mom and sister who went there  i booked it for them as a gift because i'm always there. basically it's really a nice hotel for me to do such. thank you taal vista hotel for catering my family well.,Mar,24,2014,100,pos,
agoda,I booked 4 superior mountain view rioms to be used as wedding prep rooms. During our checked in  when the hotel learned that it will be used as the wedding prep room  they upgraded 2 of our rooms to Superior Lake View for 2 night for free! Yey!,Mar,17,2014,90,pos,
agoda,nice service good quality rooms perfect view. good value for money,Mar,16,2014,90,pos,
agoda,I have no reason to come back  I had high hopes that this will be one of those stress free hotels  but I was wrong. It's a 4 star hotel located in the middle of everything you would intend to do along Tagaytay. It's right beside Sky Ranch  just across the Casino  a walking distance from the supermarket  and just a jeepney ride for other restaurant choices. Somehow  the good news for us ended there. Our room was basic  bed was decent  but it's something I could've gotten somewhere else at a lower rate  probably at a boutique type hotel where the service would have been a lot warmer. In Taal Vista  we were like ghosts  from the drive through the gates  to the check-in  down to the event the following day as well at parking. Saving grace of the hotel was the breakfast buffet  they had loads of bacon.,Mar,16,2014,53,neg,
agoda,nothing at all but maybe changes the pillow to a softer one.,Mar,15,2014,93,neg,
agoda,It was very nice and relaxing. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The rooms are large and clean as well as the restrooms. The food  specially in buffet.,Mar,12,2014,100,pos,
agoda,Perfect place to relax & unwind  friendly & attentive staff  big & clean rooms.,Mar,12,2014,97,pos,
agoda,We arrived at the hotel for check-in at almost 4pm  and I expected that I should not be waiting for a room anymore  given that check-in time is 2pm. Of course this was not the case  and when I complained about this to the manager  she even raised an eyebrow at me and did not even apologize. She did mutter a cold I will check on this  but that was about it  without any follow-throughs. You could definitely find a much better accommodation for the price of this hotel.,Mar,12,2014,97,neg,
agoda,We had a pleasant stay. Buffet breakfast had some variety. Although taste was average  we appreciate that there was bacon and an eggs/omelet station. Fast and hassle-free check-in and check-out. Rooms are situated a bit far from the main lobby  dining area and parking lot - not so convenient when you have to walk under the scorching sun mid-afternoon.,Mar,10,2014,97,pos,
agoda,The stay was comfortable  but be prepared to walk a lot! Our room took roughly 10 minutes to walk to due to the size of the hotel. But the suite that we had was perfect to see Taal Volcano. Of the majority of hotels in Tagaytay  this is probably the nicest.,Mar,09,2014,90,pos,
agoda,Our stay was absolutely fun and relax. With the view of taal volcano  the cool weather and the proximity of the restaurants are the perfect ingredients for a weekend getaway. .,Mar,07,2014,73,pos,
agoda,You could locate Taal Vista easily with its architecture. Once you get to see their viewing deck  you will be mesmerized by the view of Taal. Parking is not a problem. There are so many rooms in the new building. Good enough size of the bedroom. Filipino breakfast is also deliciuous.,Mar,07,2014,80,pos,
agoda,I will definitely go back to Taal Vista  I love the Buffet!,Mar,05,2014,80,pos,
agoda,Good. It was a great venue to relax  unwind and bond with the whole family.,Mar,01,2014,80,pos,
agoda,Taal Vista Hotel is a landmark in Tagaytay. Beautiful structure. The hotel blends in with the surroundings. It is not imposing and will give the feel that you are in the country away from the smoke and bustle of the city. It has maintained its relaxing feel despite the many developments in the area,Feb,27,2014,100,pos,
agoda,I was not happy with the room that I got. the Agoda picture of the Deluxe room and the actual room is not the same. the beds in the picture is a 1 queen and 1 single configuration  what I got was 2 single beds. Talk to the front desk but was told that it was Agoda's mistake and not them. the lake wing does not mean you will see the lake  what I got was the noisy side facing the highway.,Feb,26,2014,80,neg,
agoda,Great location. Good for family with young kinds. Accesible. Location along the highway. Food is decent.,Feb,21,2014,87,pos,
agoda,We stayed at the lake wing. Bathroom didnt have a door  when you walk into the room  you can see the faucet on the right. Shower head wasn'tt nice - made it hard to shower. toilet and shower area had a slightly foul odor. Room and linens were ok. Extra pillow had stains.,Feb,19,2014,83,neg,
agoda,Well managed  with very nice location in Tagaytay  but some rooms are very old. Though very well managed  you can see the difference compared with new hotels.,Feb,17,2014,90,pos,
agoda,Large Room  Great Staff  Fast Internet  breakfast buffet spread was too little and taste are just normal  nevertheless  it was it was a great and superb hotel! 4 thumbs up,Feb,15,2014,63,pos,
agoda,It was a sweet short vacation for my family. We really enjoyed the cold weather of Tagaytay. The location of the hotel is ideal. Thumbs up to the Pastry Chef who baked the Banana Chocolate Caramel cake which we ordered at the lobby lounge. It was so delicious! Soft  moist  not too sweet! :) The sugar free Cheesecake and Food for the Gods were also ok. My brother loved the blueberry cheesecake. The breakfast buffet was ok. Like the ensaymada bread. Also  we would like to commend Ms. Sarah and Mr. Raffy Viscal of Front Office for the fast check in and out of the hotel.,Feb,14,2014,67,pos,
agoda,2 out of the 4 rooms we used had malfunctioning tv sets. If anything can ruin a vacation  it's having a couple of guys in the room with us trying to fix the tv. In fairness  they were very nice and were able to fix the trouble. The mini ref was not working at all. This was really irritating because it was Christmas Eve and we brought so much food and drinks for the noche buena.On Christmas Day  we were expecting to have a quiet lunch at the hotel's main restaurant  which we knew had a very reasonably priced menu because we had just stayed at that hotel last February. To our dismay  they did not want to serve us anything from the menu  which they claimed would take a very long time because the kitchen was very busy with the special Christmas buffet lunch. In short  we had no choice but to eat from the buffet which cost a whopping P1 600 per person. Our only other choice would have been to get out of the hotel and scout around for another restaurant  but everyone was so famished so we just decided to stay. The saving grace of this hotel is its very gracious and courteous housekeeping and front desk staff. The plus factors are the huge bathrooms and the coffeemakers with free coffee and water. Minus factors are the small beds which are only good for 2 people. At the 2 other hotels we stayed during 2 other Christmases  both had 2 huge beds per room  large enough for 4 people. Most guests travel by families and this means it is very rare that there are only 2 people staying in one room. They better not expect their guests to get a separate room just for their children as first  it is not safe and not good practice to leave minors in another room; and second  for the price they are charging  a family should be able to fit comfortably in one room.,Feb,05,2014,80,neg,
agoda,Very good  relaxing  nice  good  nice food! Sure that we will be coming back!,Feb,04,2014,97,pos,
agoda,Our stay was almost perfect if it did not end. On a serious note  we were upgraded to the Premiere Lake room where we could see the majestic Taal Volcano. Breathtaking view! Good thing no wedding reception or conference happened during our stay so it is peaceful and relaxing. The room was huge and the design was beautiful. Toiletries were of generous amount. Room service was fast and very attentive to our needs knowing it was during peak period  just after New Year's. Breakfast with the Taal view is one for the books. I must say  we are extremely satisfied of our stay here. We will definitely be back. :),Jan,11,2014,97,pos,
agoda,The view is great  the breakfast is limited  and the air is polluted. We were surprised to see our white car all covered with thick brown colored soil or dust in just 2 nights. This maybe due to a lot of development going around the area. It was a great location  sky ranch is just beside it  restaurants are just very near  but I prefer to wait until all constructions are done before going there again.,Jan,11,2014,73,neg,
agoda,Their staff were friendly and really give their full service to their guests. The food is okay  but very limited choices. I like the hot chocolate every morning and their bulalo.,Jan,11,2014,73,pos,
agoda,We usually stay on this hotel during summer. But this time it is our first to stay here to celebrate the New Year. We arrived Dec 30 and departed Jan 1  2014. Our stay was awesome. The fireworks display was beautiful. The dinner buffet with the band singing to celebrate the new year wasl perfect . One of my best stays. I will go back again to celebrate NY pf 2015.,Jan,11,2014,83,pos,
agoda,nice hotel  friendly staffs also... we enjoyed our stay.. we spent our new years eve there & the weather was nice & pretty cold pefect for our much awaited vacation..,Jan,08,2014,100,pos,
agoda,There are beautiful views  clean rooms  and excellent staff. Breakfast and lunch are a good value. Good priced airport transfer. Very good spa treatments  reasonably priced as well.,Jan,08,2014,83,pos,
agoda,Good. Comfortable. Nice ambiance. However  if you are looking for a nice and quiet place  it's a mistake to come during the holidays esp Christmas time as the whole complex is really crowded. I think the management should not allow non-staying guests to loiter around the viewing area or veranda....at least during HOLIDAY SEASON as some people get rowdy and noisy to the inconvenience of house guests. Tried both lunch and dinner buffet. Food was good and the spread was varied and aplenty. I understand they upgraded the menu in time for the holidays. We enjoyed some happy hour at the bar with nice entertainment. Service is commendable. Overall  had a wonderful stay. Thank you taal vista hotel.,Jan,07,2014,80,pos,
agoda,my children loved the room and the location's just near the pool.staff were friendly and very helpful. the ambience was awesome with beautiful christmas decors and tall christmas trees. we had fun celebrating new years eve watching those fantastic and awesome fireworks! skyranch just beside the hotel. mcdonalds just across the street though they don't serve their usual breakfast menu. the hotel has kultura store where we bought our pasalubongs. we will surely come back to spend our christmas vacation.,Jan,06,2014,93,pos,
agoda,Though it was a brief stay  I was so happy to have spent a precious bonding moment with my family at such a comfortable place like this far from pollution  smoke  noise  etc.,Jan,05,2014,100,pos,
agoda,will definitely return and spend christmas eve again in this hotel because the staff are friendly and accomodating!,Jan,05,2014,83,pos,
agoda,Our stay at the Taal Vista Lodge was adequate. However  had I known that they had special discounts for SM Advantage card holder  I would have gotten better value. The room we stayed at was adequate but it was a bit old. Tagaytay is a cool place so swimming may not be recommended. It would have been good if they had a sauna but they didn't. The best thing about it? The fast internet service.,Jan,04,2014,53,neg,
agoda,We spent our Christmas at TAAL VISTA HOTEL  was really one of the BEST CHRISTMAS experience ever...The staff were all friendly and attentive...They even accompanied us to our room for our baggage...Location is perfect for the family...Just along the highway near to major attractions and well known restaurants...We all enjoyed our stay here and plan to go back again in the future.,Jan,04,2014,63,pos,
agoda,The staffs are well-trained and very courteous. Staffs are friendly and they respond quickly to your needs. Room size is adequate. Beds are comfortable. Needless to say that Taal Vista has one of the best views of Taal Volcano. We are quite satisfied with our stay at the hotel and will definitely stay at this hotel again in the future. To the great friendly staffs of Taal Vista- keep it up!:),Jan,03,2014,93,pos,
agoda,We had a horrible experienced from this hotel  room description were misleading  and very small rooms  this will be the last time we will stay and spent our Christmas holidays in this hotel.,Jan,03,2014,30,neg,
agoda,Taal Vista was an okay hotel. It's not a luxury hotel  but it is not bad either. It has a good view of the Taal volcano  and a sprawling lawn where the kids can run around and have fun. However  i dont like their bathrooms (lakeside). the toilet is separate from the shower  which separation i dont really mind  except that the doors to each are not really closed completely. neither is there a door separating the shower/toilet area from the rest of the room. So  when housekeeping comes in and your child or spouse is taking a poop in the toilet  housekeeping will smell everything. Neither is there a kettle in the room  though there are instant coffee and tea available. You have to request for hot water and they will provide you hot water in a pot. Would i come back? Maybe yes for the view and my children can run in the garden during nice weather  but i would not come back for hotel comfort and relaxation. I can stay in other hotels with better comforts for the same price.,Jan,03,2014,67,neg,
agoda,Satisfied with the hotel service. Great swimming pool and the free internet was a bonus.,Jan,02,2014,67,pos,
agoda,Hotel was very busy  crowded and noisy. Restaurant service and housekeeping were atrocious. Overall it was adequate for our purpose of stay at Taal Vista.,Jan,02,2014,57,neg,
agoda,Our stay was great in general. The hotel provides an awesome view of the Taal Volcano. It has its own viewing deck and a big garden where people can just sit and relax while admiring the view as well as the chill weather. The room was okay  not as big as what we expected but four people could fit in a superior room. The bathroom was huge. The swimming pool was big and they turn on the heater. Breakfast buffet was good also  they offered a variety. Some tourist destinations are accessible and walking distance such as Sky Ranch  Mushroom burger and the Casino. There is also a Mcdonalds right in front of the hotel.,Jan,02,2014,97,pos,
agoda,It was alright. The travel from Manila to Taal Vista took longer than expected due to heavy traffic. The new adventure recently constructed which is adjacent to the hotel made it worst to get through. The long drive is what discouraged us to go back to this place.,Jan,01,2014,63,neg,
agoda,We stayed in Taal Vista Hotel and I couldn't be more satisfied. The Hotel has been renovated and upgraded in every way. Aside from the great location  the rooms are big and comfortable. Taal Vista Hotel can now be considered a 5 star hotel in Tagaytay.,Jan,01,2014,77,pos,
agoda,We spent 4 nights over the 2013 Christmas period. Booked through Agoda so no Christmas package deals. At check-in we made reservations for the Christmas Eve dinner buffet  however when we arrived at the restaurant  there was no reservation and we were given a table at the extreme end of the patio area. Food was OK  typical buffet food  turkey undercooked - blood dripping. Room clean and comfortable with connecting door to children's room. Games room was a joke. room too small for snooker table  cue kept hitting the walls. One set of darts with only two flites. No refreshment facilities in games room. Gardens and surrounding well maintained as is the hotel itself. Expensive but it was the Christmas vacation period.,Dec,30,2013,73,neg,
agoda,Room was just normal clean room. it means not that fancy. but Hotel has very good view  cannot compared with another hotels. Good for lovers  family and business trip all. Try this.,Dec,30,2013,73,pos,
agoda,We stayed here in the midst of a typhoon so the view wasn't that nice and it was just foggy. Room is huge and breakfast is OK. Toilet's isn't that private  I would've liked it more if the toilet is more private.,Dec,29,2013,80,neg,
agoda,The stay was alright. It was relaxing. The breakfast was great. Its near the sky ranch. My children just walked from the hotel to sky ranch  no need to worry about the parking. The only thing that disappoints me is that our room has no view of the taal lake. I booked for a lake view but the room given is not a lake view.I did not complained  we just walked through the gardens and balcony which provides a good view of the Taal lake.,Dec,27,2013,90,pos,
agoda,No Frills and staff were very accommodating. We were able to check in and out in less than five minutes. One of the best features of the hotel is the great number of parking spaces available. I also like the security of the entire place  makes 1 feel safe.,Dec,26,2013,77,pos,
agoda,My stay at taal vista was really one of the greatest out of town experience ever. I was with my husband who was disabled at that moment. The staff were all friendly and attentive to our needs. they even accompanied us to our room everytime we go in and out of the hotel. breakfast buffet was delicious and satisfying. Location is good as well. just along the highway near major attractions and well known reataurants .over all we enjoyed our stay here.,Dec,26,2013,80,pos,
agoda,My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary in Taal Vista. It was very romantic - from the wonderful lake view  to the hug-conducive atmosphere in Tagaytay  the romantic lobby show and the sumptuous buffet breakfast. There was even a wedding concurrent to our stay in the hotel. The service was also five-star  considering that  a few years ago it was an issue in the hotel. There are many reviews available in the internet for this hotel  and I couldn't agree more to the positive reviews that this hotel has.,Dec,22,2013,80,pos,

agoda,It was relaxing and re-energizing. I tried their spa services and it was worth the price. What was significant for this hotel stay  was the courtesy and honesty of the staff who returned something I left from their hotel.,Dec,05,2013,80,pos,
agoda,My stay in this hotel is unforgettable because is the beautiful view  excellent food and excellent service of the staff..,Dec,03,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Taal Vista will always be a destination when you think about Tagaytay. It affords the best view of Taal volcano and the lake  pictures will be most memorable. Food might be steeper than the other areas but it is quite an adventure. I have been coming here for conferences but this time around  coming with my husband proved romantic especially with our suite at the Lake View wing. It just takes your breath away-- that fabulous view and especially if you can experience seeing it at different times of the day... My favorite was of course at the dawn of the new day. My husband and i waited for daylight to break and it was awesome. If we had more time  another day would have been great!-- D and S Brown Nov 2013,Dec,03,2013,100,pos,
agoda,It was great. Its my 3rd time and will still book at this hotel whenever i plan to go tagaytay again. This hotel is superb. Stayed for 3 days 2 nights and tried the mountain view  view was not so nice but the room is comfortable.,Dec,02,2013,87,pos,
agoda,The weather and traffic was cooperative at the time we stayed which apparently is something to be thankful for because traffic can be horrendous there. The hotel was spread out and it took more than the usual walk to get to our room. In exchange I suppose most rooms got a great view. The room was spacious and the amenities were great  there was even a tub. No ironing board though and no bathrobes. Its a walk away from 24hr diners including a mushroom specialty place  theres a casino across and a park with rides beside. A short ride away are everything else  more restaurants  park and a church. Great place for a conference if you want to keep the delegates confined but not feeling it.,Nov,29,2013,77,pos,
agoda,The hotel property is excellent and well maintained. Very nice pool and public areas. Great view of Taal Volcano.,Nov,28,2013,87,pos,
agoda,The Hotel is nice though very overated. Whilst the rooms were nice and clean  the surroundings are well maintained..the restaurent food was a sheer dissappointment.,Nov,27,2013,100,neg,
agoda,Satisfactory. The only complain is the there were no doors for the shower and comfort rooms.,Nov,22,2013,90,neg,
agoda,We stays here but didn't eat here  and actually only spent time in the room. The quality of the place was impressive  the room was quite nice and the view  as you may have gathered  was sensational  my only complaint was that to get such a view  I thought paying extra for the Lake Wing would do it. Alas  no. We were informed at check in that a view would be an extra 1000 pesos. Since the girl who checked us in had a prepared apology for the confusion  apparently this happens all the time. So be warned,Nov,21,2013,90,neg,
agoda,my stay was Great. Free fast wifi  nice view  clean surrounding. Though the elevators are far from the lobby.,Nov,21,2013,93,pos,
agoda,It's good time to stay at Taal Vista Hotel  it is worth as 5 star hotel.,Nov,20,2013,80,pos,
agoda,A relaxing and convenient getaway from Metro Manila. In contrast to the hotel staff - who were very professional and attentive - travelers need to be aware of the aggressive and manipulative hawkers trying to sell rides down to the lake and boat rides onward to the volcano. This sours the experience. So come prepared with an idea of how you will get down to the lake and what boat service you will use.,Nov,20,2013,73,pos,
agoda,My stay in Taal Vista is okay. Very clean surroundings  friendly staff. What I do not like is their wifi services. Poor signal.,Nov,13,2013,100,neg,
agoda,The staff are friendly specially the bellboy but the lady who accepts the stub for breakfast somewhat like a snob or belittling hotel guests..hope to let her undergo customer service training. All in all nice stay with the hotel.,Nov,07,2013,60,neg,
agoda,On the whole  it was a relaxing stay. My only complaints are 1) the bathroom sink was not cleaned very properly  2) the bath mat did not look clean being permanently stuck to the tub  and 3) the housekeeping staff did not seem to be knowledgeable about operating the new high definition TV.,Nov,06,2013,73,neg,
agoda,The hotel was clean and big  the hotel was very accomodating. I feel relaxed when i stayed in this hotel  actually it's my 2nd time here and will continue to book at this hotel whenever i will go in tagaytay for overnight stay. The view in the room was good  and they have a large place for sight seeing.,Nov,06,2013,80,pos,
agoda,as I always in tagaytay  I know taal vista hotel as its located in the heart of tagaytay. its near to fine restaurant and parks. the room is clean but hard to access the television. wi-fi is so poor and hard to access. good breakfast and staff is so accommodating.,Nov,05,2013,80,pos,

agoda,Our stay was relaxing with nice view and music with food at lobby. We did not get to see the golf courses around because of the rain. I noticed that there is horse ranch nearby. A ferry's wheel overlooking Taal lake volcano is nearby. I think there are many activities around the area. We will be back next time and spend more days.,Oct,30,2013,93,pos,
agoda,Staff is very attentive since I requested for a 2 beds but at the time of check in there is no available room with 2 beds he offered us an extra bed without any charge.,Oct,29,2013,90,pos,
agoda,Not that pleasant: (1) Long check-in process (took 20-30min) (2) Shower drainages (for the 2 rooms we got) are clogged (3) Old facilities (i.e. game room  gym) (4) Pool is too far from other rooms (need to walk in cold air going back); Pool is too small for the whole hotel. (5) Not too much choices for the breakfast food (some doesn't taste good) (6) LOW...value for what you paid for.,Oct,29,2013,53,neg,
agoda,it was comfortable and relaxing. it was an excellent weekend get away for our family,Oct,29,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It is good! If ever I will come back to Tagaytay it will be Taal Vista Hotel again..,Oct,28,2013,73,pos,
agoda,Hotel is nice  I was there for a friends wedding held on hotel lawn overlooking the lake. It was very scenic  very nice setting for a wedding. My room was average for the price and did not have a mountain view  dispite the name  as it faced a parking area. Location is quite a distance from Manila and is out on edge of town.,Oct,23,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Enjoyed our stay in this hotel. View from the hotel was relaxing & the hotel provided all that we needed. I suggest 'though to have an enclosed access from the rooms to the lobby for easy movement during rainy days. 'Appreciated much the Sunday holy mass for the guests.,Oct,19,2013,73,pos,
agoda,Very nice location you can see the task volcano lake in your room balcony,Oct,07,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It could have been better if the weather is fair. We were not able to fully enjoy the scenery because of the typhoon. Best to go in this location during the summer.,Oct,02,2013,97,neg,
agoda,My family enjoyed the sight seeing. It's worth our family bonding.,Oct,02,2013,87,pos,
agoda,The hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything that we need for our short vacation is right in the hotel: scenic view of taal  relaxed mood  fun activities  swimming pool  and friendly and attentive staff. Although the cost is a little bit pricey  the overall hotel experience is a great value for money. We will definitely come back,Sep,30,2013,87,pos,
agoda,not worth the money  incredibly un-attentive staff  every little thing that could go wrong did (noise  lengthy waits  cold food  broken fixtures  poor service  overpriced services  confusing and unmapped floor plan  etc). The staff: talagang wala silang paki-alam sa customers.,Sep,26,2013,47,neg,
agoda,We stayed for our anniversary. It was very good and will use the same hotel for our wedding,Sep,25,2013,100,pos,
agoda,It was comfortable and relaxing. My family enjoyed the food served at breakfast buffet. We all liked the souvenir at the hallway: kultura all Filipino items. The entertainment is good at the lobby especially the musicians.,Sep,25,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Relaxing weekend stay away from the city but close enough to take the road trip that takes around an hour from Makati City.,Sep,24,2013,83,pos,
agoda,My wife and I were enjoying our 42nd wedding anniversary and the on duty manager Jermaine  went out of his way to ensure we had a fantastic stay. His attention to detail in helping us find the best room with a gorgeous view was note worthy. Will return soon!!,Sep,21,2013,100,pos,
agoda,Wifi helps a lot. The parking lot though is too far from the rooms. The windows was left unlocked  an easy access for robbers to get in..,Sep,21,2013,90,neg,
agoda,Great experience!! splendid .excellent  will definitely come back in the future  will bring family and friends.,Sep,13,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Very good stay  the staff where very friendly and assisting customers well. security was in place.,Sep,13,2013,80,pos,
agoda,it was an excellent quick stay  which is closed to nightlife and the taal view is superb  highly recommended to tourist who are first timer in tagaytay.,Sep,04,2013,77,pos,
agoda,Relaxing and attentive staff. When I arrived at the room,Aug,29,2013,83,pos,
agoda,Ok very nice  its fun to stay there because you can roam around to enjoy the facilities. Especially the view of taal volcano where you can taje pictures.,Aug,29,2013,80,pos,
agoda,My stay at Taal Vista Hotel was very pleasant and at par with my expectation. It is my hotel of choice  being perfectly located at the center of what Tagaytay is known for- the view of the Taal lake. It is convenient and ideal for guests of all ages.,Aug,28,2013,83,pos,
agoda,Super attentive staff made my one night stay a pleasure. The view was fantastic to look at as was the surrounding hotel and its facilities.,Aug,23,2013,90,pos,
agoda,Very good quiet and nice to relax and good location,Aug,23,2013,93,pos,
agoda,We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. Good service and good entertainment.,Aug,22,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It was fun. I would recommend it to my relatives and friends. Planning to stay there again in the next few months.,Aug,22,2013,80,pos,
agoda,We booked the hotel for our wedding preps. It was far from the church but we still did book the hotel because of the room size and views of the Taal Volcano which was perfect for pictorial.,Aug,22,2013,87,pos,
agoda,The staff was very attentive. The rooms were large but I had myself upgraded to the Lake View Room and it was all worth it. Imagine waking up to the view of the Taal Volcano. Fantastic!,Aug,21,2013,77,pos,
agoda,After staying in various hotels in the Tagaytay area  I have decided that Taal Vista will be my home in Tagaytay. The rooms are large and well appointed. The lobby lounge is a great place to while away the afternoon with a fantastic view of the Taal Volcano.,Aug,20,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Overall the experience was very relaxing. We wanted to get-away from the stoic and crazy city life and staying at the hotel seemed to be a good choice. There is a nice view of the mountain from our window. The room was very comfortable. The weather was cool and perfect especially for couples. We tried the fried halo-halo just for kicks. It was good and unique. There is a variety of food choices in the restaurants. It is located just in front of Casino and a few minutes walk to Sky Ranch. One downside is the bathroom door. It is a tad bit difficult to slide open/close. Also the building is stretched horizontally - lakeside wing (left)  lobby (center) and mountain wing (right). We were situated at right most room of the mountain wing so getting to the lobby was quite a walk. There were only a few channels and not a lot of choices on the room service menu. But all of it was tolerable and were not really serious issues for us.,Aug,20,2013,77,pos,
agoda,relaxing  quiet  rejuvenating  nature  easy to go to and near restaurants and sights to visit but the most important thing was the privacy to our room but very far from the reataurant,Aug,20,2013,80,pos,
agoda,its quite disappointing at first because we want the mountain view room but ended up the name mountain wing is just the name of the building so i guess its quite expensive hotel with view of a rooftop. but it has a clean large bathroom and clean room and it was a pleasant stay in this hotel. unfortunately it is far from restaurants and the only transportion is jeepney  so we had to walk quite far to have dinner.,Aug,20,2013,93,neg,
agoda,ive been to taal many times but havent stayed. i would recommend taal to my friends and families  we had a wonderful and pleasant stay. i will surely comeback.,Aug,18,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Comfortable stay. Beautiful views off balconies to the Taal volcano and lake. We were upgraded to the second best suite at a discount price and enjoyed staying in a large 2 room suite with shared living area with our family. The walk to this suite is right around the hotel  but there is a shortcut from the external back side of the hotel. Kids play area is out of the way down stairs  making carrying a stroller down them uncomfortable. Toys in the playroom were broken and need upgrading. Besides this the room was top quality  food was standard  staff was friendly and hotel was attractive. There is a great souvenier shop too. The location is perfect for sightseeing.,Aug,18,2013,97,pos,
agoda,Had a great overnight stay! Check-in and check-out both hassle free. Comfortable bed  room big enough.,Aug,16,2013,87,pos,
agoda,Stayed here with my family  my fiance and my fiance's family. Amenities were okay. Parking could be confusing (mountain wing parking is quite of a walk to the other wing)  but staff are always around to help. Safe choice for a stay in Tagaytay for families. Rather boring for couples.,Aug,16,2013,97,pos,
agoda,Great! Very Quiet  Nice View of the Taal Volcano  I love the Murals,Aug,15,2013,83,pos,
agoda,We stayed for few days for my wedding in Tagaytay in July this year. Overall it was good and worth the money we paid. Luckily we booked via Agoda as booking directly to the hotel is a lot more expensive after personally checking. Booked a deluxe room with a lake view but there's actually no view in the room though the room was big and really nice. I should have asked the room to be changed but then I was too tired to do it. With a king bed and sofa bed altogether. There was a safe which didnt work at first but their staff were fast enough to settle this immediately. One wish for the hotel is for them to also provide breakfast in all rates offered by partners. This should be automatic. Also please note the wing if you book few rooms  lake wing and mountain wing is soooo at the opposite direction so walking to each room takes a lot of time and effort! The cart is only offered once you check in and you wont be able to use it after that. There's a BDO ATM machine beside the local shop on your way to the Lake Wing which is really convenient. Other than the breakfast not included in the room rates.... and quite a distance to walk to the other wing... its all good.,Aug,14,2013,90,pos,
agoda,what i did not like is i found out that i can get much cheaper rates (like 25% discounts) had i contacted the hotel itself and not through Agoda.,Aug,13,2013,77,neg,
agoda,nice hotel good food except for 1 terrrible meal... (dont order  from room service menu  the mexican chil carne... yuck !!! ) buffets were beautifully presnted and the food was good... great frozen margaritas  but a bit pricey... found all staff members very friendly and attentive... the trio of musicans was excellent.. sit in the dinning room at luch or early evening to hear them play... request spanish instrumental music.. great stuff.. nice hotel for couples... the one big complaint i had was the nightime entertainment... the entertainers/musicans are good enough  but each one cranked the amplifer so high  that it was difficult to have a soft conversation with the person next to you. It was so loud that it deterred my girlfriend and I from sitting there in the evening and enjoying drinks and desserts.... it was a big negative as that area is very beautifully decorated and comands a terrific view..but the music was completely over-powering...not the soft background sounds it should have been..... it is also a bit far to walk to local restaurants.. though a 30-50 pesos ride or 8 pesos jeepnie will get you there quick enough.Both not recommended if you are a very large or heavy person as both are tight squeezes to get into!,Aug,12,2013,83,neg,
agoda,I was really hoping for a very relaxing stay in Tagaytay City and Taal Vista really delivered. The staff are very friendly  the facilities are well-maintained  and all my requests were granted (in terms of room specifications and accommodations). Me and my girlfriend were treated like royalty  as well as everyone else (guests). I guess this raises the bar for hotels in the Philippines - probably one of the nicest  warmest places to have a fun  romantic weekend stay at. The hotel also had a great view of the Taal Volcano - probably the nearest and most breathtaking view of the volcano. Very couple-friendly and the service are consistently superb. Staff are all-smiles and are very warm to speak to. They even would engage you in genuine conversations which I found very homey and reflects the Filipino hospitality. I'd say this is one of the top three best countryside hotels in the Philippines. I hope they keep up the good work as I will definitely be coming back soon. Just positive things to say about this hotel. Two thumbs up!,Aug,11,2013,97,pos,
agoda,I initially booked a Mountain Wing Room but thereafter upgraded to Lakeview Room upon arrival. The Lakeview Room that we stayed have a clear and unobstructed view of Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. The staff were friendly also and the location is good. My only little complaint is that the Parking Lot might be packed during weekends. But overall I and my family were happy with the stay.,Aug,11,2013,83,pos,
agoda,it was very relaxing and such a great saving. we will definitely be coming back.,Aug,09,2013,97,pos,
agoda,It was great in everything but dinner menu was a bit poor,Aug,07,2013,93,neg,
agoda,good comfortable bed and pillow nice view of taal lake and volcano.,Aug,03,2013,83,pos,
agoda,Only thing I want them to improve on is customer service. Drank at the bar and there was an attendant that didn't know what she was doing. It took them 5-10 minutes for a bartender to take our orders. Other than that the stay was pleasant.,Aug,01,2013,70,neg,
agoda,Amazing place and the scenery is really good if you're a nature lover,Aug,01,2013,60,pos,
agoda,it was okay  had just expected so much. its a better place few year back than today.,Aug,01,2013,67,neg,
agoda,One of the best vacation we had. My family enjoyed the taal lake view w our premier room balcony and hot coffee  really love the place. will come back again for sure. food is good. Hotel is very clean  good smell of greenery and large and comfortable bed. Widw parking space and good restaurants. Try to order Bulalo for lunch or dinner  the best!,Jul,31,2013,93,pos,
agoda,The hotel was good! My son likes it so much. The only problem we encountered is that inside the room there are plenty tiny ants all over the mini bar and the tables. I don't know where it came from.Over all  I would rate it good! Oh the dinner buffet is not worth for the price! I think the breakfast is more worth it to try.,Jul,31,2013,77,pos,
agoda,Clean Room Nice pool (Wish it was open pasted 6pm) Good entertainment Great staff Wonderful views Really not much more to say.,Jul,26,2013,97,pos,
agoda,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay I would recommend the hotel to anyone,Jul,26,2013,97,pos,
agoda,Our stay was good and comfortable. The room price was not value for money as we only partial view of the Lake. The cheap wooden parquet flooring makes the rooms look cheap. We personally think the rates are over priced.,Jul,24,2013,70,neg,
agoda,Nice view  comfortable rooms. The bathroom need an upgrade like the toilet it does not have bidet.,Jul,24,2013,93,pos,
agoda,The location is nice but they lack in service. There is no concierge in the new wing so we have to make the trip all the way to the other bldg to make arrangements or simply validating the parking ticket everytime we go out. Even our bags  the security guard was the one who helped bring our bags to our rooms simply because ther bellboys are in the other bldg. For the room  bed was uncomfortable  comforters were worn out  pillows were not as soft as expected-i hardly had a good nights sleep. For the bathroom  there was no water bidet considering the toilet is separate from the shower. And theres no bathtub as well. The only good thing about it is the location and the cold weather  the rest was a bit disappointing.,Jul,24,2013,67,neg,
agoda,Will surely come back. Really love the place. My family enjoyed the Scnery view of the Taal lake and my grandchild enjoyed watching the clouds passing our room veranda. Premier room is much better because of the lake and garden view. Great to watch it with hot coffee. Very satisfied!,Jul,24,2013,97,pos,
agoda,I really liked our stay in Taal Vista. The room was comfortable and clean  there was enough parking  and the view was great! My biggest concern was that the staff sometimes were not so attentive. Parking also had to be validated by going to the other building of the hotel which was tedious.,Jul,24,2013,67,neg,
agoda,The room was in the basement with no elevator. The msttress was hard  towels were old and worn out. The bathroom was old and dirty. The description of the rooms in the internet was misleading. We chose Superior room but it was their standard room. The basement where our room was located was not handicap accessible with no elevator. The room was facing the grass area that was not mowed or cleared.,Jul,24,2013,40,neg,
agoda,It was awesome. I would also recommend this to my family and friends,Jul,23,2013,87,pos,
agoda,Great stay....very quite and relaxing atmosphere. I would recommend the hotel install doors to the entrance to the bathroom area in the deluxe lake view rooms for additional privacy.,Jul,14,2013,80,pos,
agoda,This was our first time to stay in Taal Vista and I've always heard good reviews for this hotel from my friends and so I thought that it was finally the time to try them out... and we didn't regret it. :) Word of the wise though: even if you book a room in the Lake Wing building  there's still a chance that you won't be given a room that has the view of Taal. We had to pay P2 000 more to get a room that has the view of Taal Lake/Volcano. Which we didn't mind.Now  the view over our room was really great! And given the atmosphere and ambiance of Tagayatay  Taal Vista really picked a sweet spot. Breakfast buffet was just okay; but the experience of having a morning meal in a cool environment  with a mystical feel around you (well  hello fog!) was very nice. Service was superb too and room service was quick. And unfortunately  we didn't get to try the swimming pool but it was just average. Not too big  and a life guard is always nearby. This is really close to the newly-opened Sky Park  so if you're up for some fun in a high ferris wheel  then go for it! We didn't do it though. Anyhow  our stay was great overall. A bit pricey though.,Jul,13,2013,83,pos,
agoda,Was a great experience. Volcano look amassing my Aussie partner first time to see a real volcano  he was impress plus casino next door.,Jul,11,2013,93,pos,

agoda,Very nice  with good service and the food was excellent,Jul,09,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It was comfortable  clean but provided little or no entertainment. The construction of the skyranch park is right beside so it was abit noisy. Was upset with the staff when they claimed we do not have complimentary breakfasts yet were given coupons for breakfast. the transport back to Manila airport was way too expensive at $3 400 pesos but we had no choice. We were even charged for a phone call to our next hotel when we asked if the staff could check for us.,Jul,07,2013,63,neg,
agoda,Enjoyed our stay here. Will recommend highly to friends who are visiting Tagaytay.,Jul,06,2013,100,pos,
agoda,Enjoy. Good to recommend to friends.,Jul,05,2013,83,pos,
agoda,Excellent comfortable stay with great views. However I found the morning buffet extremely expensive with poor variety and even most of the food was cold. Otherwise the stay was fine,Jul,04,2013,63,pos,
agoda,Disappointed by the LakeWing rooms view  which was overlooking a construction site  despite the expected Lake view.,Jul,04,2013,83,neg,
agoda,It was a great stay but was not satisfied with my request as it was specified that I requested for a Lake view but was not provided since there was this wedding function that occupied most of their rooms. They should have contacted guests about this as my intention for the stay was for relaxation.,Jul,04,2013,73,neg,
agoda,It was a great hotel w fascinating view of Taal Lake  however d AC n our room was not working properly. They didn't offer us to move to other room for our comfort   we paid extra to get an upgrade room to premium.,Jul,04,2013,73,neg,
agoda,We came as a group and the staff made accommodations to our various requests  all staff were courteous and willing to help,Jul,03,2013,77,pos,
agoda,good  and i want to go back here,Jul,03,2013,70,pos,
agoda,If you want a view of Taal Lake and Volcano Island you must pay for an upgraded room. Other wise this is a major international hotel with all the features you would expect.,Jul,01,2013,90,pos,
agoda,It was like being treated like a queen :),Jun,30,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Don't be deceived by the lake wing room option. As soon as you arrive  you will be informed that this room whilst being in the lake wing has no view of Taal. I begrudgingly forked out the extra $20 a night to have a view of the lake. The view is beautiful  it's one of the main reasons you go to Tagaytay. The other being it's beautifully cool climate.,Jun,30,2013,100,pos,
agoda,The hotel is huge  wasn't able to truly go and see all of it hence you might get lost trying to find the Kid's room or spa or the pool. They have a nice view of taal in their garden and the hotel is just walking distance away from the local casino and the sky ranch park. The bad thing though there is no view on our room. Only on premium rooms do they have views of taal or the mountains  and that costs a lot more.,Jun,29,2013,100,neg,
agoda,the hotel was an old building  old finishing  the park beside didn't finish totally. beds blanket not so clean  a lot of bug contain .,Jun,28,2013,77,neg,

agoda,BBBIIIGGG hotel stretched along lengthwise overlooking the breathtaking Taal crater. Depending on where you're located  walks can be long to get to the pool  for example. But this is minor in a modern  comfortable hotel with a great location. Close by Sky Park if you've an urge to ride a big ferris wheel with another stunning view.,Jun,23,2013,83,pos,

agoda,I wanted to stay within tagaytay because it was the nearest vacation spot we could go to at that moment. I have visited taal vista 2 years ago and since then  was interested to stay overnight. It has changed for the better and I would really want to come back. A friend of mine already booked there and I told her it was so worth it.,Jun,19,2013,73,pos,
agoda,the best so far...two thumbs up!!!!,Jun,18,2013,83,pos,
agoda,We had a great time at the hotel however our bathroom (room 203) stinks which welcomed us upon entering. Tsk tsk!,Jun,15,2013,87,neg,
agoda,great location!,Jun,15,2013,60,pos,
agoda,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary when we stayed together with our 3 teenage children. We checked in late at around 6 30 pm already and so I asked if we could request for a late check out. The receptionist immediately said yes of course with a smile on her hace. What a nice gesture! Since it was our first time to stay at this hotel we did'nt know all their facilities and amenities and was surprised to find out that they have a nice restaurant called Cafe on the Ridge. Cost of the buffet is reasonable and the ambience was good so we decided not to go out anymore. We enjoyed the music till 12 midnight and it was a memorable one. We will definitely come back and recommend this hotel to our friends.,Jun,14,2013,100,pos,
agoda,If you goto Tagatay- you must stay here to fully appreciate your holiday and the Taal Volcano!,Jun,13,2013,90,pos,
agoda,It was very pleasant. Very friendly and professional staff. The concierge by the name of Chris was very friendly and most helpful. The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained with large grounds for guests to walk and just hang out and relax. The night time appearance of the hotel was also magnificent. There are close by places to visit within walking distance such as a close by mall  a casino  and even a theme park next to the hotel. Public transport is easily accessible - just outside the hotel. There was also a McDonald's just across the road from the hotel. A very pleasant stay for sure. This is definitely one hotel I would like to stay in again if I should visit Tagaytay again.,Jun,10,2013,80,pos,
agoda,We had a great time. Meal servings are good for 2. The location was very nice because in front of it there is a casino and on its left side is a theme park for kids. ;),Jun,08,2013,87,pos,
agoda,Hotel was clean  simple but nicely decorated. breakfast - not much variety. spa was awesome!,Jun,08,2013,80,pos,
agoda,What a fabulous stay  Staff was very friendly  room was incredible  spacious and clean. The view outside the balcony was worth the money spent. The lounge and resturant were very satisfactory. Most incredible garden and views of the lake and Volcano. Sunset! Holy Cow! Fast Wi-Fi  comfortable bed and flat screen TV with HBO! Only thing was the walk to our room were kind of far but made up for it when we saw the room. For the price  I will be back soon.,Jun,07,2013,90,pos,
agoda,We enjoyed our stay there  The hotel is Just across A CAsino and adjacent to Sky Park where you can enjoy some rides while viewing Taal Volcano. Few meters you can Find lots of Restaurants that you can have a romantic dinner.,Jun,02,2013,80,pos,
agoda,We had a great time at Taal Vista Hotel. We upgraded to a crater view room as the lake view wing DOES NOT include a view of the crater lake (a bit deceptive). We had a balcony that overlooked the crater and it was spectacular. I spent each morning just viewing it with my coffee. The staff was friendly with the exception of one lady at the front desk who was very short. Overall the hotel was very nice and I would return.,May,31,2013,93,pos,
agoda,Buffet breakfast selection is expensive with the kind of food that they serve. Not enough selection but the price per person is too expensive.,May,29,2013,60,neg,
agoda,the overnight stay that i had with my family at taal vista hotel is very worthwhile. it was my first time to make a reservation via agod.com and i have to say that it's a very good experience. the check-in was short and sweet - upon my arrival  i simply presented the voucher and they started facilitating. since i have with me my passport and i immediately offered a usd deposit  the entire check-in conversation with the hotel rep was quick. we appreciated it much that they gave us rooms with connecting doors and moreso  it was on the ground floor fronting the swimming pool. my nephew and niece was just so happy about it. cleanliness and service was fast. hotel staff were attentive and very friendly. the rooms has been refurbished since my last visit there and i have to say that it looks great now! the AC was working well and the bathroom was spacious too! very happy about our stay!,May,22,2013,83,pos,
agoda,It's fine but our feet ached because of a long walk from the lobby to our rooms. Since we are attending a wedding  we are wearing our formal wear and heels so the long walk is quite a challenge.,May,22,2013,60,neg,
agoda,Stay was excellent  Hotel is very good but unfortunatly we got bad room as we imagined it will have mountains view or Taal view but it was not i got very bad under construction view either everything was perfect,May,21,2013,83,neg,
agoda,It took us more than 30 minutes to get our rooms  during rush hours specially if the hotel has scheduled weddings they should plan to have extra staff to ensure other customers are not impacted. Room was comfortable  probably the menu can have more options considering this is one of the best hotels. I liked the Spa service.,May,16,2013,63,pos,
agoda,This is my 3rd stay in Taal Vista Lodge and I will definitely be returning. The view of Taal is great. The gardens are large for the kids to run around in. The rooms in the new Lake Wing are spacious and clean. Although the pool is at the other end of the property  there are golf carts to take you there.,May,16,2013,97,pos,
agoda,Excellent  will come back. Staff is very pleasant and professional.,May,16,2013,70,pos,
agoda,Great hotel  amazing location overlooking the Taal volcano. We were able to check-in at 9am in the morning which was a pleasant surprise.Tons of nearby restaurant options  which is good because eating at the hotel was a bad experience. We waited for over 1hr for our meals to arrive in the hotel restaurant. Food was average also  except for the lobby dessert bar which was great!,May,15,2013,63,pos,
agoda,It isnice to stay to this hotel. If you want stress free place i recoomend. But the thing i dnt want  i reserve but i did not get the room wbhich i reserve a month ago.. But still thankful they allow us to checkin early.,May,15,2013,73,pos,
agoda,"Good hotel, a little old, cold and 30mns from the lake by taxi. But with a breathtaking view! the food is ok and the park is worth seeing. Bon Hotel for 2 or 3 Nights.",Mar,10,2013,77,pos,
agoda,we had fun but they should add more parking space they should add security personnel,May,02,2013,63,neg,
agoda,Excellent  the only disappointment was I tried to extend another night and they were already sold out of the room I was staying in. Would definitely go back!,May,02,2013,77,pos,
agoda,taal vista is our home in tagaytay. despite the presence of new botique hotels  it has remained very competitive in terms of overall customer experience. the view with wide spaces give you an exhilirating experience. the buffet breakfast and the lunch never fail to satisfy. i just wish the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff both in the restaurants and the rooms are consistent.,May,02,2013,100,pos,
agoda,view ix nice staff are very acccomodating but the Delux Room small kinda old ..the choices of food at room serviceis minimal n expensive .,May,01,2013,87,neg,
agoda,The price is reasonable and the room was spacious and clean. The hotel provides a good view of taal lake and volcano and provides easy access to restaurants. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. Activities for children are available. The food is great.,May,01,2013,100,pos,
agoda,The problem with this hotel is that it has a very poor room service... 1st night i asked for a bucket of ice  2 hours later i followed up but it never come. 2nd night we asked for an extra blanket after 3 hours we called again to follow up and complain why they took so long to give so finally after 30 mins they gave us. 3rd day we ordered carbonara  i asked for salt and it took almost an hour before the guy to give us the salt. (as usual we still need to ff up). We complained to the manager and he acknowledged our complains and did service recovery... otherwise it was a pleasant stay. I just hope that they will improve their service so that they'll be worthy to be called a 5-star hotel.,Apr,20,2013,70,neg,
agoda,Really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. Check in staff upgraded us to a better room. We should have paid to have a room overlooking the magnificent view and will definitely do this next time  as it it definitely worth the extra cost!,Apr,19,2013,83,pos,
agoda,"The hotel is good for Filipino standards, but has its best times behind us should be renovated. Everything is still OK, but not more.",Apr,19,2013,63,neg,
agoda,Overall we enjoyed our stay. We were a little disappointed about the size of the pool. It looked bigger on the web. We also didn't like there being no robes. Our room was listed as Deluxe Lake Wing  but there was no lake. It was a construction site. I was asked to upgrade for a better view.,Apr,18,2013,63,neg,
agoda,Great stay in the hotel where you can have nice view of the entire lake,Apr,17,2013,83,pos,
agoda,The location of Taal Vista Hotel gives the best view of Taal Lake. Eco-friendly nature and well maintained garden matched well. We love the climate in Tagaytay  its natural cool air so relaxing. Musical entertainment by singers & band adds romance to the listening guests. Nearby  there are plenty of restaurants serving good  delicious food. Overall  our stay in Taal Vista Lodge is satisfactory.,Apr,15,2013,90,pos,
agoda,The hotel has very efficient staff. The best view of Taal Lake and facilities and amenities are world class. I wouldn't recommend it for travelers on a tight budget. Do not go during the lent season  the traffic is really bad.,Apr,15,2013,80,pos,
agoda,I specially booked the more expensive lake wing  thinking that this would also mean lake view. But in this I got super disappointed. Arriving at the room  I noticed that just about 3 meters from our window was just another building. Means  not a bit of lake to see from there. The room in general is OK. Big enough  but also not extremely nice for a 5* hotel. Beside the (no) view  the most annoying thing about it was  that there is no door from the room to the bathroom- toilet. By arrival at the room we noticed that there are no bathrobes. We had to follow up twice to get finally one. The front desk manager also told us that I booked this 5* hotel thinking about having a great  romantic weekend with my girlfriend out of Manila. he would try to find another  better room for us. He took my phone number  but never came back with an answer for our request. I was just wondering; for what hes asking if everything ok  if he anyway doesnt do anything about it. Not about the bathrobe and also not about the room. The food in the restaurant is also not on a level of a 5* hotel. And me  as Im a chef  I really know about what Im saying. But just dont get me wrong  Im definitely no one who is complaining easily about everything. But the menu is simple and the dishes are missing every kind of seasoning. At least the view from the garden  where we took our meal in the afternoon  is compensating a lot! You can see the lake and the volcano crater in a really nice atmosphere! Anyway I would suggest you  to have dinner at ANTONIOS restaurant. Its just an amazing location  and the food is also pretty good. And for breakfast or brunch I would go to breakfast @ Antonios  which is much more affordable  but still very good!,Apr,12,2013,57,neg,
agoda,We had a wonderful stay. We plan to go back and stay here again the next time we are in Tagaytay.,Apr,12,2013,97,pos,

agoda,hotel was comfortable and presentable. lobby is great and elegant. mother nature is just in the hood.,Apr,12,2013,100,pos,
agoda,Had a good 2 night stay for my wedding. The room given was at the new area  the design was modern  zen type. I recommend this place for thos with extra budget. Other hotels in the area  smaller ones  have a more countryside vibe  This hotel is more of a Manila type hotel,Apr,12,2013,100,pos,
agoda,We enjoy our stay and we look forward for our next visit. Thanks for the whole staff! GOD bless you all!,Apr,11,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Very comfortable stay and a good view of the Taal lake/Volcano. You need not roam around Tagaytay to enjoy your vacation,Apr,11,2013,90,pos,
agoda,good  the only thing is our room is facing the construction area by the ferris wheel with on a partial view of Taal Lake (blocked by pile construction materials),Apr,11,2013,100,neg,
agoda,I loved the hotel. It had been a long time since I came and stayed overnight in Tagaytay and I must say I was surprised with the transformation of the hotel... :-),Apr,11,2013,73,pos,
agoda,we were a bit disappointed with the supposed upgrade we got from the hotel. having booked on a weekend  it was expected that it will be packed. the upgrade would have been good but it took us far from the swimming pool. the de luxe rooms given us also has mosquitoes. it was supposed to overlooked the garden area but no garden was in sight. the staff also gave us breakfast tickets but cancelled the same after verifying that we did not book for rooms with breakfast. it was understandable  however  one of our group members (we booked 6 rooms) who did not get an upgrade (but worked to their advantage as they are near the pool) was still given free breakfast.,Apr,10,2013,83,neg,
agoda,I enjoyed my stay. The building has high ceilings. The doormen were very welcoming. The servers And food service people were always polite  smiling. I felt very secure inside the building. I was expecting a lake view room but didnot get it.,Apr,10,2013,70,pos,
agoda,This was not our first time at Taal Vista. We choose this hotel mainly because of its good location. It's centrally located  and near the good restaurants in Tagaytay (we love to eat!). But this time  we were quite disappointed. The check-in procedure took so long. Guests were required to register first  and made to wait several minutes before being given their room card keys. The registration area looked like an airport queue. I had to follow up twice before being given our room. I don't expect this from a hotel who claims to be five-star. Yes  it's peak season  but they should know how to manage the influx of guests. And we have paid in advance! The worst part was that we paid for a lake-view room and were given a room with a view of a construction site of the nearby amusement park!,Apr,10,2013,67,neg,
agoda,Had very bad experience in checking-in. No system at all. Its quite frustrating when no one assisting you after a long drive going tomthe place. There seem to be lack of sensitivity from the reception area. The staff from the restaurant  housekeeping and managers are quite helpful.,Apr,09,2013,97,neg,
agoda,Room and cleanliness were okay. Food was not worth the amount paid as the choices were very limited especially the buffet.,Apr,08,2013,83,neg,
agoda,It was a great vacation even spent in short time. One thing I love about this hotel is the free wifi every where you go 24 hour open. The crew were very hospitable and attentive. Food was a bit expensive but it was offset ted by the good ambiance staying inside the room and around the hotel premises. Great stay and will definitely be back here again,Apr,05,2013,80,pos,
agoda,The hotel rooms are quite nice and spacious  the view is spectacular. Parking space are abundant with basement level for check in guest  security guards are courteous and the staffs are attentive. The only setback is you have to validate your parking ticket at the reception everytime you go out  also a bidet in the bathroom would be nice.,Apr,05,2013,77,pos,
agoda,attentive staff  when we complained about the air conditioned unit  they immediately attend to our needs. we had a great holy week family vacation! :),Apr,05,2013,73,pos,
agoda,My stay was good. Clean and comfortable room. However  the room and dcor was dated and old looking. The wing that we stayed in was the older part of the hotel and it needs updating.,Apr,05,2013,77,neg,
agoda,As expected since it was peak season being a holiday  the hotel was fully booked. There was nothing spectacular about the room we were assigned to. I felt that with the rate I paid for it should have included breakfast. We checked in at around 4pm since it was super traffic going up to Tagaytay via Sta Rosa that day. The hotel front desk said our room was upgraded bec the room I reserved was given to someone else but I need not pay for the difference. The room was ok...no view just a garden of cement and some plants in a pitiful effort to make it look like a garden.,Apr,05,2013,70,neg,
agoda,We love the quiet surroundings. We felt truly refreshed and energized after our stay. We would be coming back for sure.,Apr,04,2013,53,pos,
agoda,It was a nice place except I wasn't too happy with the room. It had a funny old room smell  maybe they need to renovate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.,Apr,04,2013,77,neg,
agoda,It was a very relaxing experienced. I'll probably come back to this hotel.,Apr,03,2013,80,pos,
agoda,The hotel was a five star! Very well maintaned and child friendly facilities. With free welcomed drinks,Mar,26,2013,100,pos,
agoda,we had a great time staying at taal vista hotel bec. of good food  nice view overlooking the taal volcano  nice weather  and a relaxing atmosphere inside the hotel.,Mar,22,2013,100,pos,
agoda,We had a wonderful stay; the hotel has everything a traveler needs: aside from the usual amenities of television  airconditioning and mini-ref  they provide coffee-makers and free coffee  which very few hotels do. It takes a big burden off the guests  who don't have to walk all the way to the hotel's restaurant everytime we want to have coffee. the position of our room was perfect  even though we were not facing the Taal volcano  we were right beside the swimming pool so it was very  very convenient if any of us or our children wanted to swim  it would be so easy to keep an eye on them. Best of all was the free wi-fi! This is what matters most to our family as everyone is always on the internet and people become miserable when there is no access or when the fee is so exorbitant like in most hotels where we stayed in the U.S. Also a great feature is the casino right in front of the hotel.,Mar,20,2013,63,pos,
agoda,It may be a 45-minute car ride to the lake and the volcano (the reason why most visitors come to Tagaytay) but this is a luxury hotel to be pampered in and feel spoiled. The service is perhaps a bit on the slow side (OK - very slow)  but the lobby bar was a great place to listen to music and chill out in the evenings with generous helpings of bar food at reasonable prices. The 'happy hour' is worth remembering! All in all  not the cheapest hotel but worth the money to feel a bit special for a few days!,Mar,16,2013,67,pos,
agoda,We checked into this hotel for our 1st night as married couple. The room we got was so spacious and very clean. We are very picky when it comes to bathrooms and this one has a squeaky clean restroom with a nice theme. We will surely go back to this hotel soon for an R&R in the Tagaytay area.,Mar,13,2013,77,pos,
agoda,over stay was good but needs heater on the pool when temperature drops to a cold climate. staff are accomodating,Mar,07,2013,87,pos,
agoda,View of taal volcano and the lake is excellent. Hotel is well maintained despite its age. Room is big  clean  and with quiet. Staff anywhere in the wide hotel area readily extends help and w/ a smile always. Our kid enjoyed the pool with its clean and fresh water without the chlorine.,Mar,06,2013,93,pos,
agoda,THE PLACE WAS QUITE AND SUITABLE FOR HONEYMOONERS.WE enjoyed the pool even it's too cold during our stay there. It's well maintained hotel and daily housekeeping were done but we're just surprised that we're not informed during the housekeeping in the morning  that the person can access inside our room and change every linen or towel without our knowledge.luckily our things were all intact. if you're craving for mcdonalds restaurant  it is walking distance so u can take-out and bring in to the hotel.,Mar,03,2013,67,pos,
agoda,Our stay at the hotel was a pleasant experience. We like that the room is clean and the staff were very efficient.,Feb,27,2013,80,pos,
agoda,enjoyed our stay with the kids. we were able to unwind.,Feb,27,2013,83,pos,
agoda,It was a pleasant stay  the housekeeping is very helpful and fast response to the guest request. Check-in  and check-out transaction need to be improved  and make it faster. The swimming pool is a bit small. It will be good to have an in-door heated pool especially since the location is very cold.,Feb,26,2013,87,pos,
agoda,Wonderful hotel and nice location with a best services.,Feb,23,2013,87,pos,
agoda,Generally comfortable stay. Hot water was so cool that taking a shower with only hot water was the only option. One morning I was sleeping a little late and the maid came to the door to ask if she could make up the room. My companion told her to come back later. Shortly after that I was awakened by a phone call asking if they could make up the room. This is not what I consider to be good service.,Feb,23,2013,63,pos,
agoda,It was cold at the time and so we did not use the aircon and it was still ok. The buffet breakfats is something for us to look forward to. However  our suggestion is to have yogurt in the buffet as well as other local delicacies. over-all  our stay was good thanks.,Feb,22,2013,77,pos,
agoda,We stayed at Taal Vista for our post valentines day celebration. We both came from meetings so just imagine how excited we are to just relax. I got to Tagaytay earlier than the check in time so what i did was to register and just wait for the room to be available. When i registered  their receptionist Julian swiped my credit card for the 2000 peso deposit. We finally went back to the hotel at 6pm and was told they do not have my registration on file. They were even asking us to pay another deposit. The room was a so so and so was the buffet breakfast. When we were about to check out  they were going to charge us for another night had i not check the charge slip. It was really a nightmare staying at this hotel. The other small hotels we stayed at did not have flashy uniforms for their staff bur they really banked on good training and efficient service. Our stay was a total disappointment and it definitely ruined the weekend for us.,Feb,20,2013,50,neg,
agoda,taal vista has the best view of taal lake and taal volcano among the hotels in tagaytay. the staff were very helpful. the rooms are clean and spacious. the hotel is easy to locate as it is along the main road. if you dont have a car it is rather difficult to go around because there are no taxicabs in this beautiful city.if you want to gamble  the casino is just across the street. there is also a mcdonalds in front of the hotel. i will go back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends and relatives.,Feb,20,2013,100,pos,

agoda,We planned on spending our Valentine's day in Taal Vista Hotel because we were told this is the best place to stay in Tagaytay. True enough  our stay was short but sweet. However  none of the foods we ordered matched to our expectations. Except for the coffee  the salad  cakes  beef steak  fried chicken need a lot of improvement in the taste department. We are going back again for sure  but will more likely eat out. Thanks for the wonderful time.,Feb,19,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It was a great stay with my family. The only thing is the transport  the tricycle driver asked too much fare. So next time just wait for the jeepney if you wanted to go to the mall or bus. But overall it was a great stay in this hotel especially their pool. Might come back next time.,Feb,18,2013,80,pos,
agoda,It is a nice hotel to stay and a great view of Taal Volcano. We might consider coming back to this hotel again.,Feb,18,2013,80,pos,

agoda,We were there for a friend's wedding. Service is ok although it was long holiday that week. Our baby was very comfortable walking around the hotel. Nice decors too since its nearing Christmas.,Feb,15,2013,80,pos,
agoda,Reserved room w/ view of taal volcano(partial) but was given room w/ view of a construction. You were better off leaving the drapes closed than looking a dirt view. An ugly and dirty view plus a dirty room just does not give you that aura that you are on vacay. My friends and I are traveling from the U.S. and there is no way we were going to settle for this. We were offered the upgrade for an adfitional fee right from the check-in but declined. We thought our reservations were already in the pricier room category. We definetly felt like we were set-up to upgrade.,Feb,15,2013,40,neg,
agoda,Our family liked this hotel. It is quite near Taal volcano and all the other hang-out places in Tagaytay. The lunch buffet is average. The Tagalog dishes are superb but bacon  everyone's favorite is not that crunchy. Important: Make sure to book the Premier Lake Room and enjoy the beautiful view of Taal Volcano and lake 24/7! At night  the air feels so wonderful. It's the best ambiance for wine or games/ bonding with the family. However  the downside is that the room service is a bit slow and needs follow up for simple requests like extra bottle of water.,Feb,14,2013,83,pos,
agoda,My stay in this hotel could have been perfect if not for the very poor service at the check in counter. The front desk staff seems inadequate to attend to good number of guest. I suggest that the hotel should consider beefing up their front desk during weekends and holidays as they should anticipate more guests than normal day. The front desk also  even if you book double occupancy  do not automatically give 2 sets of room keys. You still need to request this.,Feb,13,2013,43,neg,

agoda,the hotel was nice. but one big concern we had was about security! our room was opened from the outside twice (2x)where the first one was by the hotel staff and apologized that they have been given by the front desk a wrong key. the 2nd one was it was opened by another guest using a key given again to him by the front desk! it was agood thing we were in the room that time  but our concern is  what if nobody was inside and things were lost? will the hotel be responsible? other than those incidents  our stay was good and the kids enjoyed it! the massage was great!,Feb,13,2013,60,,
agoda,The hotel is nice and the service is very good. The attendants are very accommodating and services with a smile. My only adverse experienced was noisy from the sound of motor vehicle even inside the room because of its proximity with the national road. The panoramic view of the taal volcano and lake is splendour. The room rates are reasonable and the foods is also great. The Hotel features needs improvements most specially its bathroom.,Feb,11,2013,73,,
agoda,I staied there for almost 1 week and the first night was at the mountain wing where has also a nice view. But to fullfill the experience at the hotel  I recommend you to stay at the lake view. Some of the staff members are lazy that you have to tell them what you need 3 times though facility itself is perfect,Feb,11,2013,83,,
agoda,The attraction of this hotel is its great view of the Taal Volcano. In addition to this is the great service that the hotel provides. Its location is very accessible to tourist spots and major establishments!,Feb,08,2013,87,,
agoda,We make it a point to stay here once a year to enjoy the great view and bond with kids. We like the fact that the hotel is always upgrading  not only in terms of its amenities (cant wait to experience staying at the veista ranch next year!) but also the service.,Feb,06,2013,87,,
agoda,Highly recomend this hotel  5 star all the way  great service  magnificent views of volcano and lake  great choice of food and drinks. Very clean and new  very secure and very helpful staff.,Feb,04,2013,100,,
agoda,Room was for 2 but they were able to prepare the extra bed before we checked in. The problem with the mountain wing was it was too far from everything: reception/lobby area and the breakfast buffet. Compared to the other rooms  you can see that the room was already old. And the extra bed they gave us broke but we didnt bother to report it because we just stayed for a night.,Feb,01,2013,83,,
agoda,It was a romantic night for me with a cool breeze felt while walking ..the staff were very accomodating.. The room was ok.. One thing I notice the door of my room was quite hard to open.. I need to pull down hardly.. The food was great especially the sizzling bulalo.. The best!!!,Jan,31,2013,73,,
agoda,Over all good hotel. Older but well maintained and great location.,Jan,30,2013,73,,

agoda,I stay 2 days there. It's a nice hotel  best situation in Tagaytay and beautifull view on Lake. Unfortunatly  service is not in relation with hotel rate and personal expectation.,Jan,27,2013,53,,
agoda,Stayed for a day. Got a room in Lake Wing assuming it will have a view of the lake  but was overlooking concrete roof tops of other building. Eventually moved to another room paying 1000 PHP extra to get lake view. SO Lake Wing is not same as Lake View A bit noisy at the lobby and restaurants due to business being good for the Hotel. Other than that a good place to spend a couple of days while vacationing in Tagay Tay,Jan,24,2013,87,,
agoda,Booked on Agoda then upgraded to a room in the new Wing with a balcony for PhP 1500 extra per night  well worth the extra money! Room was very clean  had a beautiful view of the lake and Taal volcano. Hotel staff was very accommodating. Checked on booking a tour to the volcano with the hotel and they quoted me PhP 5800 (equal to about $140) for 2 people (car ride down to lake  boat ride out to volcano and horses and guide)  my Filipina friend negotiated with one of the locals outside McDonalds (directly across from the hotel and next to PAGCOR Casino)  for PhP 2900 (or about $70) for 2. Only difference was ride down was in a Tricycle  which I think was probably better.,Jan,21,2013,90,,
agoda,The hotel is great! The hotel gives you a great view of Taal volcano and the surrounding lake outside the rooms that are not suites. The suites offer the great Taal lake views from the windows. The hotel is near restaurants such as Lesley's Firelake Grill and Antonio's. It's also near native coffee shops like Bag O beans and Cafe Breton. Overall  it's a great experience loding at the hotel.,Jan,19,2013,100,,
agoda,a very well located hotel though a little far from taal volcano. there is not much to do in the surroundings but there is not too much need to go outside. the hotel provide all your needs.,Jan,18,2013,100,,
agoda,We were given complimentary upgrade when we arrived in the hotel. Our 3 yr old son had so much fun  there's playroom area and nice view from the hotel.,Jan,18,2013,77,,
agoda,we had to wait for our room to be ready when in fact we had checked in late. not too sure why there was a wait time  since it was a sunday adternoon and the hotel was not fully booked.,Jan,17,2013,67,,
agoda,get a deluxe or premiere room that lets you enjoy the exhilarating view of taal lake. if you want to fully enjoy a restful  serene weekend  choose taal vista. i specially would like to commend the front desk staff who accommodated my request to be upgraded from a non-view room to a room with the lake view without extra cost. i just told her i'm in tagaytay because a have to do some biz planning and i need the serenity of the lake to be able to read and plan well. true enough  after all guests have checked in since there was an available room that i requested  she upgraded my booking with no extra charge.,Jan,17,2013,93,,
agoda,This hotel is located with a good view of the Taal Lake and Taal vulcano. The staff are polite and helpful with arranging trips to Taal volcano and other.. The location is slightly high up  wich you will notice by it being a little more cold in the temperature  but for a norwegian still pretty warm. Asian were obsevated with jackeds though.. As we were tree friend travelling it was though abit quiet for us during evening and night time  and the nearby casino was not exactly our taste (a bling-bling-tacky one full of cigarette-smoke)  but fun to see. So I would recommend this place mostly to families and pares not looking for a party nightlife. It might also be abit expancive comered to other hotels nearby. We stayed two nights before we travelled on.,Jan,15,2013,90,,
agoda,the hotel is very relaxing and comfortable. we had a great time and the location is very accessible. additional bonus is the proximity of the casino!,Jan,14,2013,90,,
agoda,The rooms has been updated and renovated  in our previous stay the bed squeak and was uncomfortable to sleep  but now the facilities has been fully upgraded  new tiles  new bed   new bathroom and fixtures Except would like hotel to provide better hotel sandals   no razor blade provided in the bathroom,Jan,13,2013,77,,
agoda,From the entrance of the hotel the staffs are very respectful and accommodating. The front desk staffs are cordial and helpful. The features of the room is what we expected it to be though we didn't get the room with the view of the garden and Taal Volcano. The restaurants are very lovely  providing a full view of the garden and Taal volcano. The food is excellent but the number of staffs are few so service took awhile. the three man band is an added feature of the restaurant that provided a special delight to the guests.,Jan,12,2013,77,,
agoda,The front desk staffs were very cordial and helpful. So glad they did not give us a hard time. The room is sufficiently big for our older kids. The restaurant has the beautiful view of Taal and it adds to the overall delightful experience. The food was excellent though the staffs were few therefore took a long time to assist us. One very helpful feature of the hotel is the Kultura store where one can buy canvass bags and jackets.,Jan,12,2013,73,,
agoda,everything went well except when we checked out  apparently a couch had an old burn that we overlooked. they tried to charge us for this which was unsettling and disconcerting. Was this a scam that they pulled on guests because they use this service?,Jan,12,2013,57,,
agoda,very nice hotel  luxurious feel... staff very attentive and courteous... i very much enjoyed my stay here.....the grounds are well maintained the views  awesome. close enough to local eateries and attractions... though many times we caught a trike  (a small motorbike with a side car very popular mode of transport in the pi... though a bit tough to get in and out if your a bigger sized foreigner).. they can be found outside the hotel grounds in front of mcdonalds). should cost you no more than 30 pesos for small nearby trips. i don't gamble but there is a nearby casino located within a 5-10 minute walk. buffet breakfast was excellent... drinks were a little pricey... i have two slightly negative comments... one is super small... at night in the lounge area there was an instrumental entertainer and it would have been nice if the volume of his sound system had been turned down by 50-60% to create a soft dinner drink atmosphere... i really love the filipino people and have great respect for them... very friendly and warm but when it comes to music  they seem to enjoy one volume.. loud... the second is that this hotel is very popular and thus a bit noisy... large groups  families  functions  etc   so if you are looking for a quiet  little hideaway  this hotel might not be the ideal one for you.. all and all an excellent stay...,Jan,11,2013,87,,
agoda,We visited Tagaytay for a wedding. The Taal Vista is a lovely hotel with stunning views. Our room was very clean. We used the express laundry service (as no iron in the room) and had our cloths back within 1 hour. Staff are very friendly and happy to help out however they can. I didn't think the food was very good  but I think that's pretty normal for anywhere in the Philippines.,Jan,09,2013,80,,
agoda,Been staying at taal vista ever since they opened. Great view  relaxing rooms and very convenient location. Just the best in tagaytay.,Jan,09,2013,100,,
agoda,The location is fantastic. Staff greet you with warm smiles. We love the Taal lake view at the back of the hotel. The ambiance is great. We enjoyed the facial massage in the Spa center. The food is a bit pricey but good. We're not especially fond of the bathroom. But the room is okay. Overall we love our stay in the hotel.,Jan,09,2013,70,,
agoda,This is my first time to stay here in Taal Vista and i give it a 2-thumbs up! The location is the best since me and my mom can appreciate the view of Taal lake. It was just breathe-taking. Parking wasn't a problem since they have a lot. We stayed in the new wing of the hotel so everything looks and smells good. The only down thing with Taal Vista is their buffet which offers limited food. It is still best to eat outside the hotel. Overall  I am definitely coming back to stay for a couple of nights here.,Jan,09,2013,33,,
agoda,You need to upgrade the room if you booked through agoda to have a nice view in your room  Good thing they have wifi in the room  the restaurant is expensive,Jan,08,2013,73,,
agoda,The staff are attentive and considerate. Food is great. The best part of it is the wonderful scenery of the lake and the cool  relaxing weather. I'd go back,Jan,08,2013,77,,
agoda,The beautiful  picture-like scenery of the volcano is on your window. Nice place to have a peaceful vacation. I had my first night on agoda rate then extended one more night. My second night was even cheaper than agoda rate because of their promo. Better check their promos first before booking. Staffs were friendly especially FO agents. For f&b very slow. Almost ruined my trip but got better with sincere apology from the management. Bathroom is a bit small compared to the size of the room but tolerable. I think they also have a connecting room good for family. Foods are also nice.,Jan,08,2013,77,,
agoda,everything was good.. picturesque view  good buffet. i have reserved a superior mountain wing room for me and my husband. the room was gloomy looking and we had to walk through a loooong hallway to get to our room. Everything else was good..,Jan,06,2013,87,,
agoda,I would highly recomend the hotel for people who love to stay away from home fm time to time a bit costly but worth it.,Jan,05,2013,87,,
agoda,i did not get what i paid  i am expecting a lake view from the room but the room we got does not have a view at all. another thing is we are on the first floor and you can hear walking on the second floor. i am disapponited!,Jan,04,2013,40,,
agoda,We always stay in Taal Vista in December before Christmas. We enjoyed our stay but wished the food was as good as the past years. This year's dinner buffet is markedly inferior to previous years. The dimsum was cold  the paella was just colored rice. Nothing had great flavor. If Taal Vista does not imporve buffet  best to stay at Taal Vista and then eat out,Jan,02,2013,73,,
agoda,it is well worth the money spend. ideal for not-too-far-away from the main city vacation!,Jan,01,2013,87,,
agoda,This hotel is the premier destination in Tagaytay. The room are new and well appointed. The very nice lobby and lounge surely captivates the visitors. You can just stay in the hotel and savor the fine details of the interiors and the decors. The staff are always smiling and accommodating.,Jan,01,2013,100,,
agoda,the place is relaxing and just the right hotel to stay in when you want to get away from the noise of manila. tagaytay has developed a lot and there are many places for foodies to go to. the view of taal volcano is just amazing in the early morning.,Jan,01,2013,90,,
agoda,Checking in was easy but it wasn't warm welcome . I guess I was local so They weren't as friendly as to foreign guests  what a shame. They also Didn't tell me how to get to my room etc  I had to ask. Now here's the odd part  got in my room started to unpack And I heard Someone went in and took a piss in the bathroom. I yelled hello and it was a male housekeeper who Said sorry and was going to clean the bathroom. To Think of it shouldn't be cleaned already since it was ready To be occupied? Checked the bathroom and it was not as what you expect from A 4 star hotel. It was a bit dingy and there's a filthy ring around the Toilet. There was no alarm clock  sign for the complimentary drinks Etc. Food was ok  but steep. Overall this place fell short. I just hope they should treat All guest equal since we're all from the same country. Geez!,Dec,31,2012,60,,
agoda,During our stay the hotel was partially under renovation and it caused some noise and changes to lobby functions. Anyway the renovation should be already done at this time. Food on the menu is quite affordable for an exclusive hotel like this one  but it lacks of international dishes as there is only 5 listed if I remember correctly.,Dec,29,2012,93,,
agoda,it was our first time to stay in this hotel and all i can say is this hotel really deserve to be ranked first among the hotels in tagaytay. every cent is worth it. from the facade doown to the hotel staffs. my husband and i enjoyed our quiet and bonding moment while our five yr old son enjoyed the cool breeze and.view of taal in the hotel garden. also  our son enjoyed the small but colorful child-friendly playroom. their food was also good. we enjoyed the breakfast selection and the christmas eve dinner selection. food not to pricy also. lounge area is cozy and we had the christmas feel while listening to the chorale singing selected christmas song. thumbs up to taal vista hotel. we will definitely come back.,Dec,29,2012,97,,
agoda,It's always a pleasure staying in this hotel. we are on the third consecutive year of celebrating Christmas because of its nice weather and great view of the world's smallest volcano  Taal Volcano. The staff are very accomodating which is the main reason why we always come back in this hotel.,Dec,28,2012,93,,
agoda,I stayed here for 3 days and two nights yet  they have good and clean services. Rooms were enough with full functionality.,Dec,28,2012,83,,
agoda,very nice hotel in tagaytay very close to most of the good places to visit. staff is helpful and nice but the booking has no breakfast with it. entrance to hotel is a bit confusing because the lobby where you check in is far from where your actual room is. there is a lot of people/foot traffic going through the hotel so it makes you feel not so secure.,Dec,27,2012,70,,
agoda,The rooms are acceptable for me since we came for Tagaytay not the hotel itself. It would be better if the rooms were carpeted  good thing the room was wide enough for us (3 adults 1 toddler). I was really surprised that the bathroom doesn't have a door or a divider for privacy purposes. So when someone is taking a shower or doing the #2 in the bathroom  it's really exposed to everyone in the room. Maybe for some it's fine  but for me I want to have privacy in the bathroom. Aside from that  the room has a flat screen TV  air-conditioning was fine and a poor wifi signal. Overall my stay was great  we didn't really enjoy the amenities since we didn't have time for it.,Dec,26,2012,83,,
agoda,We were happy to learn that our room was ready ahead of schedule and we were given an upgrade to a room with a balcony and view of Taal Lake and Volcano. It was awesome. The staff in the front desk was accommodating and smiling all the time. The guards were respectful. Aside from the restaurant in the hotel there are a lot of food outlets in the strip of various international cuisine.,Dec,24,2012,80,,
agoda,Has a very great view of the volcano. Staffs were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel was accessible to the attractions just across to mc Donald's and to the casino. Highly recommended to travelers with big family.,Dec,24,2012,97,,
agoda,- Professional and hospitable service crew - Hotel premises neat  well kept and elegant - Convenient parking provisions for guests - Top notch room amenities perfect for couples or families with 2 children,Dec,22,2012,100,,
agoda,We were suppose to be booked in a premier room  on the 4th floor  but instead got the third floor. I didn't get a very good view but it was still nice. The hotel clerks just seemed to want to book our car although they should have told us that we can only stay on top of Taal for a little while due to it being so late. The extended stay for the car seemed extreme. If you're late a half hour  they charge you a whole hour. No time souvenir shopping or anything else  but a quick look at Taal.,Dec,21,2012,63,,
agoda,Deluxe lake wing implies that we will be occupying a room with a view of the taal lake. Although it was made clear in the promo details that our view was garden view  I didn't expect our view to be facing the main road. Worse  it was exactly facing Pagcor's hideous colorful facade. I also chose to stay in this hotel because I expected that it would have a freezer in the ref  as I needed to pump breastmilk. Much to my dismay  there was no freezer inside the ref. Furthermore  the housekeeping guys kept on knocking on our doors  disturbing our sleep and private time asking if we need anything but when I asked for chest w Ice i was given a flat No by the housekeeper. Didnt even try. It was as if he was expecting we didnt need anything. Worst of all  i found out that Taal Vista was offering 50% off just days before our stay.,Dec,20,2012,80,,
agoda,A great two night stay at the beginning of our trip started well with an early check in (7am in fact ) with no extra charge. The location and the grounds - lovely lawn dand balcony overlooking the lake and volcano - are definitely the selling point of this hotel. Went room only and although pricey  we were well looked after and really able to relax. Ate dinner at the restaurant which was okay  used the gym - small but a fair bit of equipment  however too cold to go in the pool and didn't take up their overpriced tours or transport. The staff were very helpful once they realised we didn't want to pay for tours but do it independently. The shower was needin attention  hot water but pressure and focus bad  flooded a little and the room could have had better heating rather than ac - minor points compared to the positives....would return again if we were back in the area.,Dec,20,2012,87,,
agoda,Did not quite enjoy our stay due to the room given was not really prepared when we checked-in. The light did not turn on when we put the key in the slot  the bathroom gets flooded and the TV in one of the rooms was not operational mainly because upon checking the remote battery was wrongly put. The main concern is the bathroom. The expectation of being a five star hotel was disappointing. We paid the right amount  we expected the right service.,Dec,19,2012,63,,
agoda,This hotel is good value but very small old style New York rooms. It feels very cramped very soon. Quite lesser standard than othr Best Western Hotels in USA (as expected becasue it is in NY). But very good location close to all the action.,Dec,18,2012,67,,
agoda,Let me clear the matter up first... I bought from Agoda a deluxe room on the lake wing. This is a bit misleading because of the terminology used by the hotel. A deluxe room is like a budget room WITHOUT a view. To get the view to die for you need to upgrade ( which i was thankful for .. i paid 25 USD equivalent to go to PREMIERE Lake view). I waited for 30m but it was so worth it - the room is larger and the view from the balcony is the absolute greatest you can get at Tagaytay. There is no breakfast but who cares... you can get breakfast from a Maccers just across the road  the location is convenient that you are within distance to all the restos granted you have a car. Inside and outside the hotel is like night and day. Outside  third world - Inside  First world. Try it out and you will see what i mean. Just goes to show what a beautiful place Tagaytay could be if managed properly which is a testament to how well this hotel is managed. Enjoyed my stay definitely coming back.,Dec,18,2012,97,,
agoda,We had a great time in this hotel and excellent service... The place is so relaxing and have a very good ambiance.,Dec,18,2012,93,,
agoda,Excellent hotel with grerat staff  great food and great view!,Dec,16,2012,100,,
agoda,I was hesitant at first because of what I remembered about Taal Vista. But I was surprised that it's now fully renovated and refurbished! SM did a good job at it! The front desk was very helpful and the amenities were complete. Parking's a bit of a problem when there's an event but otherwise  a great stay!,Dec,12,2012,90,,
agoda,The room was good  though said it was overlooking the lake  our room was not so. It can only view a bit of the lake but we can mainly see the construction on the next lot. Other than that the experience was great,Dec,12,2012,77,,
agoda,It was raining most of the time  so there was no view of Taal except for about half an hour.. but if the weather is nice  the view is amazing. Not all of the rooms have a view of the lake. But you can always walk out to the viewing area near the lobby. The lobby is nice and there is usually some relaxing music or entertainment going on at night.. The spa is very nice  but it was a VERY far walk from our room. By the time I got back to my room I needed another foot massage I believe they are currently renovating the rooms closer to the spa. It is better to have your own car  as most of the attractions and restaurants are a little far away. The security is very good here  but almost too good. For example they required us to walk out to the lobby to meet the McDonald's delivery ourselves. They would not allow him to deliver to the room  so that was an inconvenient surprise. Overall the staff is very professional  and property is nice  and they are busy with renovating a large part of it  so it should be even better soon. I would consider this a good place for business or convention stays. Best for couples or groups of adults  not the best for families with small kids.,Dec,10,2012,73,,
agoda,This hotel has a wonderful view of Taal volcano. They have excellent staff who attend to your needs.,Dec,10,2012,97,,
agoda,the view of the surrounding was expectacular  everywhere you go. there is a nice place to stay  sit back or just relax  enjoy the cold weather. treat yourself to the great buffet. even the breakfast is superb! at night you can hang out in diffrent places. one is distillery where you can drink alchoholic beverages.,Dec,05,2012,100,,
agoda,We had an incredible stay in Taal Vista Hotel. looking forward to our next visit to the place.,Dec,04,2012,100,,
agoda,We were booked at the superior room/mountain wing but was supposedly upgraded to lakeside. The reason given by the front desk person was that the mountain wing rooms were fully booked. Since it was free of charge  we were happy about the upgrade  initially. I have stayed at the mountain wing rooms with my family and I would say that I still prefer that wing. It was nearer the pool where we could just lounge after a dip. In the first place  the view from our room was a construction of a building. Secondly  since there were two wedding celebrations  the floor was almost always noisy because the rooms in our floor were mostly occupied by the entourage in the wedding.Next time  we would insist on getting a room at the mountain wing since that was what we have reserved for.They have just been newly refurbished  anyway. And  our room did not have a sofa bed,Dec,04,2012,87,,
agoda,We spent a weekend with two other couples and we had a fantastic stay. We stayed in the new Wing where the air condition works much better than in the old building. Some of us had a view of the volcano from the room and it is worth paying a bit extra to wake up to this breathtaking view. We had an afternoon dip in the nicely chilled pool  it was really refreshing. The evening buffet at the hotel was a bit disappointing and was not what it used to be when we first time visited Taal Vista Hotel some years back.,Dec,01,2012,80,,
agoda,we always go to taal vista every year. i like the spaciousness of the room.,Nov,29,2012,93,,
agoda,This is the hotel to stay if you don't want to go out to other places in Tagaytay. By just staying inside the hotel will already make you relax.,Nov,28,2012,90,,
agoda,Very enjoyable weekend stay  everything was as it should be  service  staff and food was top notch,Nov,28,2012,100,,
agoda,We booked this hotel room as part of our wedding party. Every one person in their staff was more than attentive (even if they did not know that we're part of the wedding party) to our every need. There was always someone to assist me in bringing in luggage and stuff up to my room. I recommend Taal Vista because of its excellent service and good food for their functions. Breakfast buffet food is just okay but I've had lunch there also on another occasion and it's good.,Nov,24,2012,90,,
agoda,We enjoyed our stay.the place was clean  the staff were accommodating and very friendly. Surely  we will stay there again.,Nov,23,2012,80,,
agoda,We had a great stay at Taal Vista Hotel.My family enjoyed a lot and hope to come back again.To the staff  keep up the good work.,Nov,23,2012,83,,
agoda,I feel relaxed and wanted to go back again! The view are great and the service and you get a warmth welcome from the staff! Highly recommended!,Nov,15,2012,90,,
agoda,the room is simple just like in a small hotel. it was mountain wing but i did not see a nice view from the room. the bathroom is bigger but no water hose. the staff are accomodating and the service is quick. there is nice view from the hotel,Nov,14,2012,80,,
agoda,the hotel is very clean and safe. the rooms are clean but could be updated a little. the staff is very polite and helpful. the resturaunt and lounge are great and offer a nice view too. the on-sight spa and pool were very nice. the fitness center was a little small and seemed to be an after thought. overall  this place is worth it.,Nov,14,2012,87,,
agoda,The check-in was fast  and the staff at the front desk were great. You have the best view of the Taal volcano and lake from the lobby. The kids enjoyed the outdoor  taking pictures while enjoying the breeze and the view. The rooms were comfortable though a bit far from the main reception. The room service and housekeeping were prompt enough to deliver our food and requests.,Nov,10,2012,93,,
agoda,the room is great and is very clean. the hotel has poor wifi signal though.,Nov,10,2012,77,,
agoda,It was good to stay at taal vista hotel  upon arrival and checking in the staff are very accomodating and pleasant to us...rooms are also good and very clean..for sure our next visit to tagaytay i still choose to stay at Taal vista hotel,Nov,09,2012,83,,
agoda,i love the taal vista. it has all the amenities we are looking for like the sight seeing  swimming pool and good food.,Nov,07,2012,80,,
agoda,Taal Vista has one of the best romantic views of the Taal Lake and the volcano itself. Hotel has been there for decades  but current management has done a great job of making it new again. Great ambiance (very romantic for couples). Downside is that the Deluxe Lake Wing rooms are quite misleading  as they don't actually face towards the Taal lake. Room we got is actually facing the main road  which can be a bit noisy at times when big vehicles pass by. But the room is quite good and spacious. Hotel service seems great too  and hotel staff are very helpful and accommodating.,Nov,07,2012,93,,
agoda,The hotel is just about OK. First the good part- Conveniently located and even if one does not have own transport  one can get other means of transport. Nice garden and open area for kids to play. Service is average. The way the toilet and bath area is designed  it might not be comfortable for a lot of guests. I was in Deluxe Lake View enough Suite but there was no bath tub though there was enough space for the toilet and bathroom to be designed Being vegetarians  we hardly had choices in food.,Nov,07,2012,77,,
agoda,don't get taken by the lake view. we booked for a lake view room expecting that the room would be facing the tall lake. the room given was in the lakeview section of the hotel but the room was facing the street in front of the hotel. the front desk explained that the rooms facing the lake was the premier rooms and it costs double. the room was big and clean. big bathroom and toilet but towels need to be replaced. we went there on a long weekend and the hotel was full. the hotel does not have a big common area to hang out.,Nov,06,2012,67,,
agoda,we arrived a little early for check in but the room was already ready. no fuss checking in. our ac was not properly functioning when we got there but they promptly sent maintenance staff to address our concern. they gave us the option of transferring to a different room and have us check it out. in the end we stayed where we were since the ac was fixed. our room attendant was polite and very helpful. all in all it was a nice stay.,Nov,06,2012,90,,
agoda,The Taal Vista Hotel has come a long way. It is now a very modern and classy hotel. When my family stayed at this hotel in the 90s it was falling apart and dirty. Nobody can say the same now. There are more rooms and making a reservation is much easier than before. With the new rooms  there are also more people and hence the corridors of the hotel are noisy. Since the corridors are not carpeted  the sound of people walking and talking along the corridors is carried into the rooms. As a result  light sleepers like myself are sometimes bothered by people shuffling and carousing around the hallways. Our check-in was delayed because one of our rooms had a clogged drain. It took the front desk more than an hour to give us other rooms but this was understandable because the hotel was booked solid during the weekend we were there. We lost a lot of daylight because of the delay but the hotel upgraded 2 of our 3 rooms to make up.,Nov,06,2012,83,,
agoda,all my expectations were met and will come back as soon as we can!,Nov,05,2012,77,,
agoda,the taal vista hotel offers a great stay for families with children since they can run around the sprawling garden overlooking the scenic taal volcano and lake. the ambiance was nice the staff were very friendly and attentive to your every need. the price is reasonable and the food at the lobby lounge is okay. our kids wanted to take a dip at the pool but since the pool is not heated  we only went for a short while but all the amenities you want are available.,Nov,05,2012,77,,
agoda,I remember Tagaytay as really nice place- beautiful natural beauty with cool weather & wonderful lake & volcano views. Now it is too developed and alas  the grand Taal Vista Lodge is showing its age. The room had a funky smell. It seemed like a moldy kind of scent. Also room shows its age. The view is still spectacular but the veranda/viewing deck etc needed some sprucing up.,Oct,31,2012,60,,
agoda,Great Stay. I will recommend this to my friend if they're looking for a relaxing place to stay.,Oct,31,2012,83,,
agoda,Lovely hotel  has good customer service and is in a great location.,Oct,31,2012,90,,
agoda,the kids loved the cool weather and the view of the taal volcano.,Oct,27,2012,100,,
agoda,the kids loved the cool weather and the view of the taal volcano.,Oct,27,2012,100,,
agoda,We always value Taal Vista Hotel. The Last time we were here was during our honeymoon. We came back more than a decade after with 2 kids. We have noticed several improvements: 1. The facilities are more modern; 2. there are more rooms facing Taal Lake; 3. The weekend buffet and the cultural show are absolutely fantastic and highly recommended for tourists and balikbayans; 4. The evening live music performance at the lobby is perfect,Oct,25,2012,90,,
agoda,we stayed with our young children and they really enjoyed the whole stay because of the perfect ambiance and the rooms are big enough to accommodate us,Oct,23,2012,80,,
agoda,always a relaxing stay at taal vista. try to book a premier room at the new wing as this is really spacious with a balcony and spectacular view of taal lake. this room is usually quiet and serene specially at night when you can see the lights down at the lake. staff are incredibly nice and sweet to us breakfast buffet is ok but could be improved more. overall  it was still a good experience and we would still come back  as we always do.,Oct,23,2012,80,,
agoda,Peerless location  and favored by a crisp  cool climate  Taal Vista Hotel is your perfect haven in Tagaytay. The view is excellent  if you make sure you request for it. While the old wing needs some renovation and comfortable beds  better amenities  it costs lesser than the East wing. I would look out for promos in the future and stay at the newer wing. The welcome drink is a good plus  though it would be nice to have options than a very sweet iced tea.,Oct,23,2012,77,,
agoda,It was mainly positive experience. I would be careful when you book to get the deluxe rooms with lake view. The mountain wing is closer to the pool  the rooms are big but the room setup of large twin rooms in mountain wing was not ideal for married couples on a holiday. Staff were excellent. There is no bar as europeans might expect  so afternoon drinks were in the lobby  the atmosphere might be a bit overpowering with the piano and the strings some nights  it is however a 5 star hotel so i guess a cosy corner bar might not be exactly why people would go there,Oct,22,2012,87,,
agoda,We've stayed here so many times already. It's always been an enjoyable experience. Cool weather  all sorts of eateries all around the place clean comfortable rooms  best view of the volcano  delicious meals  isolated from the hustle & bustle of Manila... what more can you ask for? When in Tagaytay city  this is probably the only place to spend your freetime.,Oct,17,2012,97,,
agoda,when we arrived at the hotel i was asked if i would like to upgrade to a room with the view of taal lake and i did for an extra pay  which is very reasonable.it is nice and quiet both me and my wife like the place. i recommend this hotel to anybody that would like to stay in a decent hotel.,Oct,15,2012,87,,
agoda,There was construction and actually half the hotel was closed. Despite the inconvenience  the hotel staff more than made up for remodeling.,Oct,11,2012,97,,
agoda,I recommend a stay in that place  our rate was quite affordable at this time. Room was clean and spacious even so the shower didnt function perfectly  For that amount we paid for sure a very good deal for philippine hotel standards. I will return for sure  staff is friendly breakfast is various and good.,Oct,11,2012,90,,
agoda,The room is spacious and is very clean. I still think its pricey for $ a night. Check-in process has no organization. I guess you can't blame the hotel personnel but they don't implement that people fall in line so that guests are checked in based on a first come first serve basis. I bought just a deluxe room from Agoda and was offered an upgrade for additional pesos per night. The guest relations officer mentioned that if I book through them directly  I would be able to get free breakfast for the same price that I paid. I asked if she can somehow give me the breakfasts for the days I stayed there as complimentary since I purchased the upgrade to a lake view room and that I'm part of a wedding party staying in the same hotel. She laughed at me and said no. I think that's very rude and unprofessional. The bellboys are very helpful. The bed is comfortable. The tv is flat screen. There's a safety deposit box. Lot of storage and closet space. There's complimentary coffee  tea and 2 small bottles of water. Very good lighting. There's extra pillow provided. Only 2 bath towels  2 scrub cloth and a floor mat is provided. They should provide at least 2 floor mats and 2 hand towels. It would be nice if they will provide iron as their pressing service is expensive. Breakfast is good. Horrible lunch  dinner and cake. A bottle of water is 100 pesos!!! The cocktails are horrible. Service at the lounge is really bad. The servers know nothing when you ask information about their menu. You will be seated for 30 minutes but nobody will come to give you a menu. You have to ask for it. You also need to stand up and walk to the desk where all the servers are standing. There's a lot if people working at the cafe but they don't pay attention to the customers. You have to approach them every time you need something.,Oct,11,2012,70,,
agoda,i like here because the perfect view of the hotel!,Oct,06,2012,80,,
agoda,booked 2 rooms for overnight stay for my mom's bday celebration. rooms are clean and staff are friendly and helpful. one of the best places to stay in tagaytay.,Oct,04,2012,87,,
agoda,It's my 2nd time to stay here. Tagaytay is about 2hrs from Manila  and the cool weather is perfect for a relaxing weekend getaway  which is perfectly complemented by a stay in Taal Vista. Their rooms are clean  well-maintained  comfortable  and cozy. We spent most of our time just lounging in our room! One small problem I had was with the hot water  and I love my hot showers. The water pressure is great and the water is quite hot  but on occasion the hot water fluctuates and becomes cold. Also  their room service menu could offer more choices. Overall  this was a very relaxing stay and is still highly recommended.,Oct,04,2012,93,,
agoda,The hotel is very a great place for families.They had a friendly staff and nice sightseeing area.Nice place to relax and unwind.The hotel is located in the central part of the city that's why it's very near in the restaurants  bars  parks & churches.,Oct,03,2012,90,,
agoda,This hotel is great for family and couples to spend one or more night out of Manila.,Oct,03,2012,83,,
agoda,made a last minute booking due to my husband's conference. so far taal vista has the best view of taal lake that i've been to. hotel ground is quite big & rooms too! quite surprised of that. unlike other hotels that provide 2 single beds  their beds for twin rooms are a good sized 2 double-beds. overall  can't complain from cleanliness  rooms  service & facilities. early check-in request was hassle free. something to improve on would be the food. breakfast & lunch choices are quite limited & bland.,Oct,02,2012,80,,
agoda,I got this hotel because of the early-bird rate and I was positively surprised. Very well located (100php by taxi from the most central places in Makati)  rooms are fairly spacious and well equipped and the internet in the room works well. I will be back for sure.,Sep,27,2012,83,,
agoda,All the staffs are very polite. The lady chef is a really nice person.,Sep,27,2012,97,,
agoda,Enjoyed the hotel facilities. Near to good nightlife and local shopping.,Sep,26,2012,87,,
agoda,Our stay was great  it was very relaxing. Nice view!,Sep,25,2012,70,,
agoda,We booked this room 3 months in advance since I knew that we will be on these dates because my brother-in-law was getting married. When we arrived  the bellboys greeted us and took our luggage for safe keeping until we are checked-in. When they found out that we were in the grooms entourage. They upgraded our rooms somewhere nearer to the groom's suite. Otherwise  we would have been on the other wing which was at least 500 meters away. Thanks guys!!,Sep,24,2012,87,,
agoda,the place is good the taal view is very relaxing and the personel are very friendly and accommodating.,Sep,24,2012,80,,
agoda,My girlfriend and I went here last week  we were surprised to book a room in such affordablw price which offers a comfortable and relaxing place! The view was spectacular and the staff are very nice. Their location is also near in tgaytay's attractions and best restaurants! Plus upon Check out they'll give you a discount voucher so that you will be able to use it on your next stay. We will definitely go back here!,Sep,21,2012,100,,
agoda,Very nice hotel right on the rim of the Taal lake and volcano. Unfortunately it was very foggy with mixed drizzle and rain and the lake could not be seen. I wanted to take in the lunch buffet but was put back with the nearly 1000 Philippine peso per person charge. My wife and I walked across the street to a MacDonalds and let the buffet stew in it's high price. A very nice hotel overall but it seemed more suited for the event  conference crowd rather than travelers. I gave the food/dining a rating of poor only because of the outrageous price.,Sep,21,2012,70,,
agoda,we were upgraded to a premier room with mountain views and bigger beds when we found out that their reservations office neglected to mention they had a promo. they were able to give us everything we asked for - rooms next to each other and big beds capable of accommodating the entire family,Sep,20,2012,100,,
agoda,Probably not the best  but good enough for Tagaytay. They're currently undergoing renovation so we were asked to take a shuttle to our room which was a little inconvenient. The rooms are okay and clean...same goes for the bathrooms. If you're willing to spend a little more  look elsewhere.,Sep,19,2012,77,,
agoda,The hotel facilities are excellent. Staff were very friendly. Breakfast buffet is very sumptuous. There is also a mass on a convention hall on a Sunday which is very convenient.,Sep,18,2012,100,,
agoda,I was so happy with the service most of the staffs are friendly and accommodating. I love the room that was given to us it was quite big for a couple and our room was upgraded. We will definitely go back to Taal Vista. Excellent Service!! :),Sep,18,2012,97,,
agoda,We stayed here for 3 nights. The rooms are very clean and the staff is very helpfull. The view in the room was not so nice  but the view from the deck was beautiful. Each morning we went there just to enjoy the view. The spa at the hotel was also very good. I would certainly come back if we go to Tagaytay again.,Sep,15,2012,97,,
agoda,Overall I am satisfied with the Hotel's service. My complaint re the cooling system in the room where I was transferred was attended to. My only disappointment is the hotel has a promo for SM Advantage Cardholders like me wherein the room rate that I got goes with complimentary breakfast for 2. I had to pay for my aunt's and my breakfast.,Sep,11,2012,80,,
agoda,nice place to stay however the mountain view side is the old side o taal vista shoukd have chosen the other which has bigger and cleaner and new rooms. bathrooms not that clean too.,Sep,07,2012,60,,
agoda,Room was okay. Hotel room service was prompt. Their buffet spread wasn't that impressive though.,Sep,05,2012,67,,
agoda,Enjoyed our stay overall. Wished that the rooms had better noise prevention because you could literally hear everything going around -- footsteps in the corridor  light switching on and off next room  even conversation happening in the room across.,Aug,30,2012,77,,
agoda,Hotel is in a good location. Has a good view of the Taal volcano and very near to other restaurants. Staff were very friendly and accomodating upon check in. Rooms are suprisingly very big and very clean. Buffet breakfast was superb  had a lot of choices.,Aug,30,2012,87,,
agoda,Taal Vista has the perfect view of Taal volcano. I appreciate the helpful staff and very good room accommodation. Also  the Hotel is handicapped friendly  as my mom is in wheelchair. The kids enjoyed the pool as well as the playroom. The food with the cultural show was also a different experience.,Aug,30,2012,87,,
agoda,it was really a nice experience. we like everything about the hotel. the guest relations people are very friendly and polite. all the staff greets you with a smile everytime you pass by. the room is very beutiful as my childrens and my really liked it especially the bed. really helped us unwind and be totally relaxed. well do it again next year.,Aug,30,2012,100,,
agoda,i enjoyed the location.most notable is the friendly and accommodating attitude of everyone serving in the hotel.,Aug,30,2012,100,,
agoda,Promo hotel room was really old. Could have paid for a better hotel room for the same rate. Felt like i paid for the name instead if the room. East wing room (promo room) has a scary connecting door. Bathroom tiles were full of cracks. Bring your own toiletries. Good thing we just stayed for a day. Not going back to Taal Vista unless all rooms are renovated. Not value for my money.,Aug,28,2012,43,,
agoda,our stay in the hotel was very relaxing and peaceful. Good view of the taal volcano. the staffs are very nice. Breakfast was ok. limited variety of food for dinner. Mass celebration is also held inside the hotel  so its very convenient,Aug,24,2012,77,,
agoda,Nice amenities but the wifi is very sluggish and intermittent.,Aug,23,2012,67,,
agoda,Great place the views are unreal as is the food and staff nothing is and problem we totally enjoyed our stay,Aug,23,2012,90,,
agoda,i will not be going back there. i don't consider it value for money. it is already a very old hotel. food is not very good. the croutons in the salad i ate were stale and they even initially refused to change it. staff is trained to say no to every reasonable or standard request. terrible service. not happy during my stay there at all. parking was so far from the place we were billeted.,Aug,22,2012,23,,
agoda,The hotel staff are accommodatin and  friendly. The place is perfect for resting and relaxation.,Aug,21,2012,80,,
agoda,My family enjoyed our stay in the hotel. We were able to have fun  bond  relax and just enjoy each other's company. We also loved the fantastic view of Taal  such beauty... As long as the volcano doesn't erupt :D The hotel also has a playroom but I'm quite disappointed in this area because I don't think it is being managed properly.,Aug,18,2012,87,,
agoda,Great location  i like the staff as they are friendly  I just dont like the room where i stayed  it was so old and its not worth for what i payed  no views from my room.,Aug,15,2012,63,,
agoda,Enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Our group was looking at the hotel to watch the Pacquiao/Bradley fight. We were placed in the new East Wing of the hotel which had new facilities. Overall the price we paid for the room was worth it. Clean and Modern rooms.,Aug,14,2012,90,,
agoda,We stayed 7 nights based on our 2009 stay the Taal vista has some good standard but became a very systematic and impersonal hotel. There is no taxi  and hotel is offering transportation is quiet expensive for a 5 minute drive to the town where most of other 5 star resort in philippines offering a free shuttle to the town,Aug,13,2012,67,,
agoda,During rainy season it's hard to go from one side of hotel rooms to lobby. Not too many people during weekdays. A bit deserted if you are a solo traveler. It's best with a group of friends going on a day trip or weekend.,Aug,13,2012,73,,
agoda,it was great..staff were so helpful and quick service..,Aug,12,2012,83,,
agoda,It was raining for the most part and really didn't have much time to use the facilities as much. The room was too far from the lobby  but the staff were pleasant.,Aug,10,2012,67,,
agoda,Upon arriving at the hotel  concierge was a bit awkward as to giving us the details of the room. Stubs are given for the welcome drink. It would be more welcoming if they greeted us with the drink and remove the stubs. The room is big for two  I requested for a big bed and it was given. I loved the bed. Pretty obvious that this is an old hotel as some minor renovation is needed. Need to change stocks for the mini bar as some are really old. CR is big too  needs minor renovation. Rooms were far away from the lobby which ok for me as I don't like people walking left and right our room. However  the stay in general is good.,Aug,07,2012,70,,
agoda,guards at the entrance were very nice and helpful.. receptionist were really helpful as well :) the room was ok very clean and complete with all the things a traveler needs.. room service was very good aswell as they respond to request fast...,Aug,07,2012,90,,
agoda,I will recommend this hotel to people planning a trip at Tagaytay  best view ever.,Aug,04,2012,93,,
agoda,I frequently stay at this hotel but during this stay the noise in the room was almost unbearable. You would know that somebody is passing by the hallway because of the sound that they make. Also the sound proofing should be improved because at the middle of the night I could hear the conversation of the people at the next room. Check-in and check-out was very fast and the staff were couteous. Too bad the room was noisy and the free wifi was very slow and unreliable.,Aug,02,2012,80,,
agoda,It's good that they renovated this hotel. But they still need to upgrade the rooms to serve customers better. Traffic get heavy during the weekend due to the number of visitors who goes to Tagaytay during the weekend. The buffet in this hotel is also a must try for those who have good appetites. Sunset view from this hotel is also a must see  make sure you hang-out outside the view deck of the hotel before sunset. Don't forget to bring your camera.,Aug,02,2012,77,,
agoda,it is a good way to relax and spend a weekend getaway with family. it's accessibility to different restaurants and shopping mall brings you to a worry free vacation.,Jul,28,2012,90,,
agoda,Lovely hotel and service with a smile,Jul,26,2012,100,,
agoda,Our stay for 2 nights were pleasant. Enjoyed the hotel view but the room is kinda small. We attended a reunion and had a very good dinner event. The staff were polite and very pleasant . The location has a very good view of theTaal Lake and we enjoyed the scenic atmosphere. Other than this sinceI always book thru Agoda even for my relatives  we enjoyed our stay inTaal Vista Lodge.,Jul,25,2012,80,,
agoda,big and spacious room  a little bit stuffy though  probably because it has not been used for a long time  nonetheless  the room is clean  staffs are friendly and courteous  location is near well known establishments.,Jul,24,2012,73,,
agoda,It was an overnight stay and we had a wonderful evening,Jul,22,2012,60,,
agoda,"Have a nice stay at this hotel. The rooms are clean and clean. The service very professional. You may notice that this hotel has existed for a while. Fantastic view of Lake Language and the Volcano. Also have a very good health & wellness department. Only downside: Breakfast closes early for people who want to sleep well.
",Jun,22,2012,77,,
agoda,I proposed to my fiance here. Everything about our stay was simple and uncomplicated yet in a luxury setting. We will return for our first anniversary because the memories are so good from the relaxed traditional Filipino breakfast overlooking the volcano and surrounding islands to the wide variety of restaurants a brief stroll down the road. Loved every minute!!,Jul,22,2012,60,,
agoda,This hotel has been around for sometime and a few of its buildings are a bit worn and torn  but the hotel is going through some reservation work and things should improve. Room medium size was clean and tidy and comfortable.Make sure you request a lake view if you want one. Brunch was ok but expensive. The spa was good value with good staff. Infact all the hotel staff are very helpfull.Generally a good stay in a pleasant hotel. WIFI free and in the room.,Jul,20,2012,100,,
agoda,Taal Vista Hotel is definitely overrated  a 5-star it is not. More of a 3-star to a low 4-star. The disappointment started when after reaching the hotel building (3-5 minute walk from reception building)  we found out that the ONLY elevator to reach the 2nd floor is not working. Upon asking someone from housekeeping on how we can go up  we were pointed to the same elevator. When we said that it was not working  she expressed surprised  ran to the basement stairs  and after a few seconds...the elevator was working again. We entered an old cramped elevator. After a minute or two (note that we are just going one floor up)  the elevator opened to a...portable blackboard??? Apparently  the EMERGENCY exit area was being renovated (don't know why) and they found it fit to use a blackboard to block it...and the elevator partly. Upon reaching the hotel room  the floor and furnishing was already old (definitely more than 10 years already). Bed  mattress and beddings look old as well. My mom  who was in another room with my siblings  that Taal Vista was a 5-star on its heyday  which was ummnh..20 years ago?? It was just a relief that the aircon was at least newer and was working. We felt like we were robbed of the expensive booking we made  as we could have gotten better and newer accommodations (with breakfast even) somewhere else. Definitely we will not go back there again.,Jul,19,2012,73,,
agoda,booked a total of 10 rooms in this hotel for our wedding guests. 8 superior rooms and 1 ruby suite in the west wing (old) and 1 deluxe room in the east wing (new). surprisingly  we were disappointed with the new wing. the charm of this pre-ww2 hotel was totally lost in the new wing and the rooms were smaller. the fixtures were newer but felt cheap and already showed signs of wear. granted  the old wing fixtures need to be replaced soon but the rooms were bigger and more relaxing. really surprising given that this is one of the more expensive hotels in the area. breakfast was so-so for its price and a better deal with better options can be had at the buffet breakfast offered by bag of beans which is less than 5 minutes away by car. the best feature of this hotel is that it can boast one of the best views of the taal volcano from tagaytay. it is also across the street from a large casino. it's also next to a place where kids can ride horses handled by guides.,Jul,18,2012,57,,
agoda,we often go to tagaytay to escape our busy manila lives but this is the first time we stayed at this hotel. we enjoyed our overnight stay very much and we wished we could have stayed longer. from our check in until we left  the staff have been very courteous  helpful and attentive. the hotel offers a picturesque view of taal volcano so we didn't have to go to the other view sites anymore and we had more time to see other attractions,Jul,18,2012,67,,
agoda,My stay with Taal Vista was great. The hotel is so elegant with spacious room. The staff are friendly and very accomodating. What I love the place is very peaceful you can really relaxed and enjoy the scenery of Tagaytay. The only thing that made it unpleasant was the leakage in the room due to heavy rain and the only remedy the hotel provide was a towel to absorb the leak. Upon our checked out the the front desk and the information was unaware of the leaked and i hope they fix it because it will be rainy season soon so probably more heavy rains. And im sure other guest would not like to hear the dripping sound when they went to sleep. I have a another suggestion  i hope you could make it a more welcoming to the guest regarding the complementary drinks upon check in i hope you could just give the guest instantly a welcome drink and not a stub to claim a drink.,Jul,18,2012,80,,
agoda,They were kind enough to extend our stay since we arrived early in the morning. Wish they just improve a bit in room service.,Jul,13,2012,80,,
agoda,It was a nice place to stay in and good if you want to explore the volcano and the views were great!!!,Jul,11,2012,67,,
agoda,had a great stay. warm friendly staff from doormen to house keepers. great location. will stay again,Jul,10,2012,43,,
agoda,Our stay in Taal Vista in the East Wing was great  however  with the price i paid  the package did not include breakfast.,Jul,10,2012,93,,
agoda,I booked two superior rooms for a party of four. Prior to checking in at the hotel  I corresponded with the hotel per E-mail to find out whether the supeior rooms had a view of Taal lake. I quickly got a response from Asst. Vice President for Marketing  who graciously answered all my queries. Though the superior rooms only had garden views  offered me an upgrade to a premiere room  which had a Taal lake view  for a nominal fee. I decided  however  to stick to my original booking. Nevertheless  Ms. Fong instructed her staff to block the best superior rooms for my arrival. I checked in late at the hotel  way past the usual 2 p.m. check in time. who was at the front desk at that time  apologized that  despite my late arrival  my rooms were not yet ready for occupancy. To make up for this  immediately ugraded my party to a premiere room. The room with a view !! What more could I ask for. The premiere room  which was located at the east wing of the hotel  was large and had a balcony with a breathtaking view of Taal lake. Complimentary coffee and tea were also offered in the room. For those who can't do without their laptops  the wi-fi signal in the room was strong. The only setback was that the pool was a bit of a way. One had to walk all the way to the west wing where the pool was located. The west wing was also where the superior rooms were located. The evening buffet at the Caf on the Ridge  the hotel restaurant  had a good selection. However  I think the desserts could have been better. All in all a great experience. I'd do it again.,Jul,04,2012,97,,
agoda,Hi Me and my husband together in a twin room We were not provided with a queen or king size bed.,Jul,03,2012,57,,
agoda,Memorable holiday. Friendly and accomodating staff.,Jul,03,2012,67,,
agoda,there are many hotels in taal tagaytay. while this one may mot provide the best n most moder rooms it provides by far the best overlooking panoramic location. staff is friendly. the basic rooms are somewhat reminiscent of an old tired model at least viewed from outside. but they are not bad even if slitly overpriced. the pool on the other hand is an absolute shame. small and was crawling with dozens of children. in sum great view. tired rooms. friendly staff lousy pool,Jul,02,2012,70,,
agoda,The staff was the best and the veiw was even better. Over all great experience and I will def return!,Jul,02,2012,100,,
agoda,We checked in late but the staff was efficient enough to give us the best room. Welcome deinks were offered over the lounge. Morning al fresco breakfast was average but it was the view that is captivating in a foggy morning. We had a comfortable uneventful stay.,Jul,01,2012,73,,
agoda,I have always chosen Taal Vista as my hotel whenever I go to Tagaytay. Besides the superb view  their staff are very nice and accommodating. Food is great  too! No wonder Taal Vista has been one of the leading hotels in the area,Jun,28,2012,100,,
agoda,we enjoy our stay at the hotel. the staff name was very nice to us. the room was nice.,Jun,26,2012,100,,
agoda,room should be renovated  they are old  internet lousy,Jun,25,2012,43,,
agoda,We stayed at the West side of Taal Vista. The room looks old with parquet flooring full of scratches & some dried stains. The beddings and linen look old too. Same with the towels which appear overused. The shower and bath tub facilities are old models(could be 4 decades old  Marcos era vintage). The view from the window is not appealing; dwellings across the fenced hotel are small wooden shacks w/ galvanized roofing which trees cannot hide. The elevator looks old too and seems to be just in running condition. The gym is too small and ill-equipped  its standard is way below when compared with the spacious and modern gym of today's 5-star hotels. Nonetheless  we defer final judgment of the country's pre-war venerable hotel  formerly Taal Vista Lodge (which was envisioned as the junior extension of the Manila Hotel from the south of Manila) because there was a notice from the closed right side of the West wing  the other half of the building  that it is currently undergoing rehabilitation/refurbishing. However  the cool quiet environment and astounding sight of Taal Volcano from the spacious viewing terrace  open to all hotel guests  may compensate to stymie the declining standard of this once majestic hotel.,Jun,24,2012,57,,
agoda,Initially  room accommodation was a problem from the 3 adult room we reserved they gave us twin. They advised us they can squeeze a cot bed but that was entirely different. They gave us the option for upgrade as soon as rooms were available. We opted to prioritize upgrade for the 2 other-same-type reservation we did for our guests the following day. In its finality  One was upgraded w/o charge  the other there was no complain and  us our other daughter stayed with her sister-bride the night before the wedding and with friends after. On the accommodation the rooms were fresh and comfortable  and the services were ok  the staff were courteous and smiling.,Jun,24,2012,97,,
agoda,The staff are all nice and polite especially the staff of their restaurant by the ridge. We enjoyed sightseeing at the view deck. This place is perfect for people who loves photography because they will surely get great photos at the view deck. However  the rooms are old and needs some refurbishing. Their mini fridge won't work but they provided us free bucket of ice. The aircon is also not that cool anymore and needs some cleaning or replacement too. That will surely make the rooms more comfortable.,Jun,22,2012,73,,
agoda,The hotel is quite old  especially the room where we stayed in (the west wing). But nevertheless  everything we need in the room is provided for and the place is very near to almost everything. But I was somehow disappointed to see that our room doesn't have a nice view coz it was somehow stated in the room info that we should be expecting a ridge or mountain view. What we saw was a grassy area with lots of debris & some sort of garbage. Aside from these  the room was far from the main lobby  front desk and restaurant. But you may just consider that as a good exercise. During breakfast  my companion signed our receipt to be charged to our room. Although I had already registered my companion's name upon check-in  they did not acknowledge her signature and still asked for me to sign it myself. Does this mean that if I did not join my friend for breakfast  they will not allow her to charge it to our room? I was wondering why they had to register my companion if they will not acknowledge that person? Lastly  I think the cost of breakfast is too expensive for the amount and quality of food they serve.,Jun,18,2012,53,,
agoda,Taal Vista Lodge provide good accommodation with clean and spacious room. It location on Taal Ridge provides a great over looking view of Taal Volcano the hotel is conveniently located near fine restaurant within and outside the hotel. Tagaytay itself provide convenient escape from busy Manila  with its cool climate and scenic spots,Jun,18,2012,93,,
agoda,the food was good  but a little bit pricey. location is excellent. the rooms were nice and service was good,Jun,18,2012,80,,
agoda,the hotel sits on a huge property. i was impressed with the friendly front desk personnel who handled us when we checked in. he upgraded the room of our children to deluxe room so we can be beside each other even without us asking for it. that kind of sensitivity to your guests is what makes you stand out. generally  the staff were friendly. however i find the waiter serving us with our drinks that night where we stayed outside of the restaurant area  not quite friendly and seem unhappy doing his job. facilities are great especially for conventions too.,Jun,18,2012,83,,
agoda,location isgood and rooms are well maintained but expcted rm view of mountain become perimeter fence :p,Jun,16,2012,77,,
agoda,we stayed at the hotel just for an overnight stay. we were upgraded to a deluxe room so we can be beside our parents' room. that was great. we appreciate that gesture since it makes us feel that taal vista hotel front desk team cares about their guests and willing to extend an extra mile in their service even if you do not request it. they were sensitive enough to make your stay wonderful even for just a short stay. the hotel sits on a huge property and since we stayed only for a night  we were not able to really go around. we saw only one pool. we hope that management will build another pool because it is quite far from the new wing.,Jun,13,2012,87,,
agoda,Stayed for 2 nights at a deluxe suite. The view was great! The room size was big and the king-sized bed was comfy. Had a little problem with air-conditioning but was immediately solved by hotel maintenance. Very clean especially the bathroom. A little on the steep side when it comes to rates but it is a 5-star hotel. Overall an excellent stay.,Jun,13,2012,93,,
agoda,we have enjoyed staying at this hotel very much. the staff are very kind and helpful. we arrived into the hotel t night and we did not have the hotel voucher with us but they let us in the room and discuss business the next day. we also  made a mistake in our reservation days and the management were so kind to accept the changes with no charges. this shows how customer oriented management this hotel management has.,Jun,13,2012,97,,
agoda,the hotel was in the new wing...although nice it was too far from the main lobby and the other amenities. there should be more golf carts to use to transfer guests from one place to another,Jun,12,2012,77,,
agoda,initially  when we were informed that we'll be at the old wing i feared of the damp and eerie accommodation especially when the good for 3 adults booked on line turned out to be twin and the other bed is a cot bed to be squeezed in. i pleaded for them to upgrade for my other 2 booked same category guests. one was accommodated the other did'nt mention any discomfort. my other daughter who was supposed to join us stayed with her sister's suite bride room. everything ended well that ends well,Jun,09,2012,90,,
agoda,this is already my second stay with this hotel before i become a member of agoda. the nice thing in staying with this hotel is its features  facilities and nice staff. you can roam around the hotel  without bothering to go out because it has an area with a good view of taal lake and volcano at the back.,Jun,06,2012,100,,
agoda,refrigerator not working  broken bathroom door and missing main door latch. the room that i occupied should not be offered to guests.,Jun,06,2012,30,,
agoda,check in was a breeze. we were off to our room in no time. room was cozy  clean and had all we needed for our overnight stay. the weather  however  wasn't so friendly. the rain cooled off the early morning heat from the last vestiges of summer. unfortunately  the hotel's storm drain traversing our room's cieling needed some repairs. this wasn't much of a problem as the hotel staff immediately transferred us to another room. the quick response and assistance from the friendly hotel staff was more than enough to cover for this minor inconvenience. overall  our stay was pleasant.,Jun,05,2012,77,,
agoda,good location and great view of taal volcano. too many people though during the weekend we were there. too many events (weddings  seminars  etc) happening at the same time. friendly and efficient staff. finishing of the new wing needs improvement (not at par with a real 5-star hotel),Jun,05,2012,70,,
agoda,i paid singapore dollars for my room and an extra bed. i paid us dollars for another room using the hotel's own website. i ended up with two rooms that were exactly alike except for an extra bed. i don't feel the extra bed is worth 75 singapore dollars considering we only stayed one night. only one passcard was provides per room. a real hassle. also the lock to the toilet was busted so we had to agree to knock before entering. the rooms were clean with good air-conditioning. internet access was free though. we also reserved for a 4 person room but were provided toiletries for 2. after calling for more  they provided the balance. they had a medium size pool complete with lifeguard  open from 7 am to 6 pm. they also have a nice restaurant with good reasonably priced food and a great view.,Jun,03,2012,67,,
agoda,loved the view. staff was very greetful and helpful. great room and relaxing. tv had lots of good channels too and food was awesome. the only thing was the water pressure and temperature in shower was random but eventually worked proper after it ran a few minutes. great place to take a loved one.,Jun,03,2012,100,,
agoda,its my third time of stay in this hotel cause its the no.1 choice of the family because of ite best location. just go at the back of the hotel and you will have the best view of the world smallest volcano  the staff are very accomodating and friendly and the foods are great!,Jun,02,2012,83,,
agoda,no problem in check in & out - very professional staff great location for great view at taal lake and volcano but a bit pricey even not including breakfast however the facility maintenance was poor,May,31,2012,73,,
agoda,The room is bid and clean  hotel staff basically are friendly  but no restaurant or Pub around the hotel vincinty  unless take a few minutes Jeepney ride away from the hotel,May,29,2012,67,,
agoda,Me and my girlfriend went there by bus  then jeep coming from Manila - the commute was painless. You would immediately be able to notice the hotel's facade. Entering its gates  walking  felt a bit awkward as expected from most hotels of this type  their entrances are made from drive-ins  nevertheless  the guards on duty were very courteous in greeting us and in instructing us the way to the concierge. Their view deck of the Taal Lake and Volcano was romantic and awesome! The hotel is definitely worthy of the name Taal Vista! We arrived early from our scheduled check-in time  yet  the room was already prepared for us. Going to the room was quite an adventure. Their compound is quite large  plus  they lack a bit in directive wall posts. We would've been easily irritated by this  but when we asked assistance from one RANDOM hotel employee  we were immediately offered  enthusiastically  to be escorted to our room. The superior room was good - value for money is A-OK. Bedding was clean and fresh - you could actually smell a hint of the cleaning agents they use for laundry. The only thing that I could complain a little bit about is that the bathtub didn't look healthy to bathe-in. It was unfortunate that our room was not located at a vantage point for viewing the Taal Lake from the balcony  though do note that the view wasn't bad enough to spoil the quality of the room. Food was terrific and org**mic! We ordered quite a variety from their menu and EVERYTHING was SUPERB! We definitely would go back to Taal Vista!,May,29,2012,97,,
agoda,Relaxing and pleasurable to stay at. Huge space and nice design of the interior.,May,29,2012,93,,
agoda,I stayed in Taal Vista for 3 nights to attend a convention accross the street. The staff are efficient and friendly. The food in the Cafe is reasonably priced and good enough. Certainly better than MacDonald's across the street. Tho' I did not avail of the other facilities  judging by the number of guests in the hotel  I surmise that Taal Vista is one of the best within the Tagaytay area.,May,23,2012,70,,
agoda,they are all accomodating and the service id fast.,May,23,2012,80,,
agoda,great stay in the hotel at the weekend very much with checkin and out.breakfast buffet much too expensive small selection.pool is ok for kids.,May,22,2012,80,,
agoda,Being one of the most famous hotels in tagaytay  this is set apart from the numerous b&b's in tagaytay. Service is great but nothing outstanding. although we just stayed for a night and didnt spend much time in the hotel during the day. I would go back just because we didnt encounter any problems.,May,20,2012,83,,
agoda,i like the room we satayed in...its very spacious and very clean...i like the view especially when we had our breakfast buffet.,May,20,2012,100,,
agoda,Beautiful place . The service is exceptionally amazing. People are very polite and friendly. food is great.,May,18,2012,97,,
agoda,Me and my friends stayed here to celebrate my friend's engagement. No hassle during our late night check-in. The room was lovely with a big bathroom. We stayed at the 3rd floor and we can see the swimming pool from the hallway. The room looks newly renovated but not the hallway. I wish they could repaint the walls and replace the flooring of the hall way to match the ambience of the room. It is also near bars and restaurants. The pool looks so inviting so of course we jumped in the next day. Best thing about this hotel is the spectacular view of the Taal Volcano in their garden. I would recommend this hotel for those who want to relax.,May,18,2012,67,,
agoda,Our stay here in Taal Vista Hotel is good. All the staff are nice and friendly. They have some cool hotel features and I like their swimming pool a lot. Overall I can give this hotel a 4 star out of possible 5. And by the way you can go to the casino across the hotel to make some fun.,May,17,2012,70,,
agoda,Taal Vista Hotel is beautifully located. It's front is the main hiway  at the back is one of the best views of the Philippines famous volcano...Taal Volcano in the middle of the lake. As soon as you enter the hotel property  you are greeted by friendly and courteous smiles from the gate guards  to the front desk personnel to the bell hops. The room was big and clean  though not new; The food is ok. And the service is tops.,May,16,2012,77,,
agoda,I wondered how the Vista will turn out when it was purchased by a company known as a megamall conglomerate. Service at their malls used to be below average. I was pleasantly surprised to find out otherwise. It started with a phone call the day before check in I made speaking to Julian confirming our reservation. Then we dined ala carte at the restaurant by the lobby where there were 3 wonderful ladies who served us and were so concerned that my young son might get hungry and offered to serve him soup from the buffet. The food was not that bad. We ordered soup  fish and a pizza for our toddler. Paul of the front desk was also very warm  gladly making sure he tried his best to accommodate my early check in when I explained we needed a place to freshen up and change for a wedding we were attending. There was a pleasant guard who always smiled and greeted by the West Wing entrance. Even room attendants we met in the hallways were cheerful and eager to help. On another note though  a bellboy did not arrive upon our request for assistance to bring out our bags for check-out. I deem this understandable since it was a busy time being 12n with everybody checking out at the same time and it was Mother's Day to add. I just hope the hotel will address this in the future. The place is clean and tidy. Being an older hotel  there was just a distinct 'smell'  not that unpleasant to me nothing that a little refurbishing cannot solve. The towels and sheets could be whiter. I hope they do something about the linens to add a more luxurious feel about the stay. Nothwithstanding those  I would say the Vista remains to be one of the top choices in its class for Tagaytay hotels considering the service I have experienced there.,May,16,2012,67,,
agoda,it's a nice hotel although its bit old but clean and staffs are helpful.,May,15,2012,77,,
agoda,i often stay at taal vista  its very nice to sit back and look over the taal volcano enjoying a glass or two of wine. my stay here is always nice  the staff are very welcoming and the service is great. the food is wonderful  one of the best hamburgers i have had. the rooms are spacious and very comfortable. the new section of the hotel is very nice where as the older part does need a remake but is very clean and still nice.,May,14,2012,90,,
agoda,the rooms on the west wing of the hotel are showing their age and should be renovated soon but taal vista is still one of the best places to stay in tagaytay. it arguably has the best view of taal volcano and is located near the casinos  restaurants  and other points of interest.,May,10,2012,83,,
agoda,overall my stay was very pleasant. hotel staff were great and always looking to ensure you were ok. only downside was my room looked into a plain small courtyard  but this was no real issue. one day i will be back,May,08,2012,87,,
agoda,service can do some improvement but overall a satisfactory hotel.,May,08,2012,73,,
agoda,We stayed in Taal Vista for my cousin's wedding and it was an excellent wedding venue. The staff was very helpful and they were very friendly. We stayed an extra hour after the wedding and the staff didn't complain about staying back. We paid an extra amount but wasn't very expensive at all. The room we stayed in was the west wing and we had a great view of the Taal volcano  it was so nice to see it when you wake up in the morning. Love the Taal Vista and we highly recommend it.,May,06,2012,100,,
agoda,The room was ok. no complain about it but the outside view  we cannot see the taal from our room. Hopefully next time the staff will us a room which have a breath-taking view,May,05,2012,93,,
agoda,nice and enjoyable stay. really enjoyed it. it's fun to be back to the hotel after several years.,May,03,2012,87,,
agoda,we really had a awesome stay at Taal vista hotel.. we enjoyed every single moment we spend at that palace. My children had fun on the pool provided by the hotel. my nephew told me that the personnel inside and even outside the hotel are hospitable and cheerful.To sum it up! good job guys! wish to stay again at your hotel. Keep it up and God bless!,May,03,2012,77,,
agoda,We had a great time in this hotel. Enjoyed the pool  gym and game room  and especially the view.Will definitely comeback.,May,01,2012,97,,
agoda,everyone knows taal vista. it is a landmark in tagaytay. taal vista has been taal vista even from my younger days. but time has also taken its toll on this great hotel. we were booked at a room in the older wing of the hotel. (we were told that a new wing is under construction). our room is due for renovation. the wooden floor is badly scratched  the aircon is noisy  and even the aircon vents looked really dirty. notwithstanding the rooms  we still found our stay enjoyable. my husband and i brought with us our 2 kids  aged 4 & 6  my mom  2 sisters and the latter's boyfriend. despite the cold weather  the kids took a quick dip in the pool. the adults enjoyed the spectacular view of taal volcano. and the breakfast buffet was really good!,Apr,30,2012,80,,
agoda,We had great time here. Cool place. Nice surroundings.,Apr,29,2012,70,,
agoda,We are all satisfied in terms of services and locations. Accessible for the nightlife and my son was so happy because of the Mcdonalds location accross the hotel. The swimming pool is so great and the staff were so accomodating and friendly especially at the restaurant.,Apr,24,2012,80,,
agoda,enjoyed our stay and with your excellent service makes it more commendable. however  even with our citizen discount card (20%) we were not given the discount because we booked thru agoda. any chance for re-imbursement?,Apr,23,2012,100,,
agoda,i was very pleased with our stay here. as well us my husband  he felt relaxed during our stay. the west wing we stayed seemed newly renovated or just had a face lift except for the flooring. it has the view of the pool on the hall way and the view of the lake from the room's window. very nice. it is perfect to go to tagaytay during the hot summer for its cooler breeze and only couple of hours away from manila. and another highlight was the best price we got.,Apr,22,2012,87,,
agoda,the hotel is very clean  accessible. the employees are courteous  friendly and accommodating. the pool would be better if its a little warm.,Apr,21,2012,87,,
agoda,i like the location but the ameneties like pool is not. because we cannot use the pool after 6pm due to restriction of the hotel policy  which is not normal.,Apr,20,2012,70,,
agoda,tall vista hoel is great location to stay because ihas many amenities there like the ver big view from taal lake  it is overlooking  swimming pool  children's playground  gym for the adults  spa outlet  billiard hall  restaurant funnctions rooms for occasions  big rooms for the guests and many more. they have also gardens that can be viewed and have pictorials for the whole family. it was pleasant and wonderful travel experienced for us. i hope this was not the first and last tour in taal vista.,Apr,20,2012,73,,
agoda,the reason why we were in tagaytay was because of a wedding -- since we are the bridesmaids for the wedding  we stayed where the bride and groom are staying as well as the other entourage and families. the hotel is very nice :) the west wing is a bit old -- but it's still very pretty! the east wing is where the bride's room was and the room was pretty and it was massive :p we weren't able to try the food because being abroad for a few months  we missed sisig! so we ate at gerry's near the hotel. the hotel is also near a supermarket -- so it has a good location and the scenery is so wonderful -- i would recommend it to anyone who is getting married :) having the taal volcano and lake as your backdrop -- who wouldn't have beautiful pictures during the wedding day? :),Apr,18,2012,90,,
agoda,From the moment you check-in  until the time of your check-out  you will have a great day because of courteous staff  beautiful room  and perfect view.,Apr,15,2012,100,,
agoda,Front desk did not advise view of the Taal Lake behind main bldg of the hotel  assigned room without any view but delapitadated rusty fence of next lot...didnt offer upgrade if available room with a nice view is available...lousy front desk service...but bellboy  concierge very courteous and helpful as well as housekeeping. I find it that if reservation is done online the least kind of room is assigned  front desk never accomodating to fyi additional amenities of hotel.,Apr,14,2012,63,,
agoda,loved our return trip. will be back for a third trip as still didnt complete all the excursions and sights,Apr,14,2012,83,,
agoda,This is a nice hotel located on the main road  But has a long driveway allowing rooms to be set back from the trafic noise. The pool is beautiful but is small and was rather busy. Our room was comfortable with king size bed and large tv. Tricycles and jeepney were easily accesable from out front or if u prefer the hotel could arrange for a driver to take u anywhere you want to go.,Apr,12,2012,87,,
agoda,The very reason why I booked in the hotel was to have the Taal Volcano and lake view from my hotel room as I planned to cocoon myself meditating throughout the Holy Week. I specified that in my special request portion of the hotel booking. But upon checking  I realized that they booked me in the East wing where the only view that I got was a slab of cement and the empty convention room below. I tried asking the front desk personnel if I can get the very reason why I decided to stay there but I was told that that I should even be happy that I got upgraded to a better room. And it all went downhill from there. Imagine a key reason for your stay unfulfilled. I could have just stayed in my own room and experienced the cold air-conditioned temperature for five days for free.,Apr,12,2012,57,,
agoda,I frequently visit tagaytay for short vacations to enjoy the weather away from the city. We normally stay at Taal Vista because of its location and the friendly staff. However  through the years the hotel needs an up keeping of their rooms and facilities. In this trip there were some disappointments. Based on the room given to us  wooden doors are becoming rusty  door lock was broken  refrigerator does not cool properly and the water stopped when I was in the middle of taking a shower. Hotel Rooms in the west side needs upgrading.,Apr,12,2012,70,,
agoda,among all the hotels in tagaytay  taal vista hotel is my favorite. the hotel location is good  plus it offers the best view of the taal lake. visitors though are better off eating outside the hotel  as the restaurant within the hotel is quite pricey. on my last visit  hotel service was not up to par either  since it was a peak season. in my opnion though  taal vista hotel is still the best place to stay in tagaytay.,Apr,10,2012,70,,

agoda,Taal Vista still has its charm because of the best view of the volcano and the history of the hotel. Service is nice but not the best I've experienced. Employees tend to get pressure when handling large crowds but I see them trying their best. The rooms are well maintained considering the age of the hotel. I think the hotel still has some potential that has not been maximized yet. Ameninities like the pool and some more activities that can be done within the hotel would be great. The food is okay but also not the best compared to other hotels I've been. Adding 1 or 2 more restaurants would be nice.,Apr,09,2012,77,,
agoda,great place! recommended for family vacation spot.,Apr,09,2012,67,,
agoda,we stayed 2 nights and booked 4 superior rooms located at the west side. rooms are a bit worn out with parquet floors looking in need of replacement. the nice thing about the rooms were they were all interconnected with each other making it convenient for us as we were with other relatives during our stay. the hotel itself is still very lovely and renovated but they have to fix the west side rooms to make it truly the only 5 star hotel in tagaytay. food was great and staff very nice and accommodating. we didnt even have to request for an extra bed as advised by frontdesk as they have a couch which can be used comfortably as a bed. we only requested for bed sheet and blanket which cost us nothing.,Apr,08,2012,70,,
agoda,location is very good & nice view of the lake.employees are very accomodating & good service but room needs updating you can hear next doors conversation. furnitures & tv needs replacement,Mar,22,2012,80,,
agoda,we have enjoyed our stay in taal vista with great view of taal volcano at our window.,Mar,22,2012,90,,
agoda,This hotel looks like the kind of place an average person can't afford. The rate we got was actually lower than what we paid at another hotel in the area which was not nearly as nice. The room was large  the bed was comfortable. The linens were clean  as was everything else in the room. The bathroom was spacious. Everything worked well. Room Service delivered hot  delicious food promptly. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was excellent. The made to order eggs and omelets were excellent. There was a large selection of both Philippine and American/European items. I believe this is the nicest place I have ever stayed. I haven't even mentioned the view  which is spectacular. There is a beautiful swimming pool  and a well equipped fitness center.,Mar,17,2012,97,,
agoda,This is my second time at Taal Vista Hotel. We were attending a friend's wedding the next day at Nasugbu  Batangas and this hotel has the perfect location. We find Taal Vista a reliable  safe hotel  located at the heart of the city. We still chose to stay at the west wing where the old rooms are located. In our previous stay  we observed that the rooms are due for renovation. This time  we noticed some improvement like the wall paint and the aircon vents looked cleaner. We also loved the breakfast buffet during our previous stay. It was a weekend then and we observed that there were more food options before. We missed the beef tapa this time. It was also our first time to try out the lobby cafe. The buko pie ala mode was great!,Mar,17,2012,83,,
agoda,very unprofessional place to stay in overall  very unwelcoming attitude from staff  it was as if they didnt need your custom,Mar,10,2012,47,,
agoda,The staff were not able to provide good information about getting to the lake and crater. They were not organised for tourists and did not facilitate our visit. There was no live music  which the Philippines was well known for. Such a pity! Transport costs within the town using the hotel facilities was a ripoff. The rooms had seen better days and was in need of a facelift. Towels were well worn.,Mar,05,2012,47,,
agoda,I have always liked going back to Taal Vista Hotel  the only premier hotel in Tagaytay. Service is very good  the rooms a spacious and serves good food. You will never go wrong when staying at Taal Vista Hotel.,Mar,03,2012,90,,
agoda,Although it has a great location with lots of open space  the rooms are rather old and needs to be renovated. The staff seems rather unfriendly  service is rather poor. For the prices  I do not recommend this hotel.,Feb,20,2012,47,,
agoda,I had a great time staying at Taal Vista. It is one of the premier choices for hotels in Tagaytay that's affordable,Feb,16,2012,80,,
agoda,Water boiler has not worked. Otherwise everything OK.,Feb,15,2012,77,,
agoda,For a 5 star hotel  the food was a tad disappointing. The room rates on AGODA which i paid for  was not as competitive as a walk in/rack rate- which I obtained last minute at the Hotel. The Agoda site promised us and charged for a triple-share room but the size of room we got was small for my sisters and me.,Feb,09,2012,57,,
agoda,overnight stay was good. facilities were clean if a little bit outdated. hotel management should already consider getting flat screen tvs in all their rooms.,Feb,03,2012,87,,
agoda,the entire stay was a-ok. the hotel staff were all very courteous and helpful   the rooms clean and odor free  the hotel location was perfect inasmuch as it is near the areas we intended to see  like the residence inn  the mushroomburger  the many restaurants around the area  plus the biggest factor would be its view of the volcano and lake which is indeed superb .,Jan,31,2012,93,,
agoda,we had a great time at the hotel. we enjoyed the cold weather and the rooms are nice and clean. the size of the room is appropriate for us and we enjoyed the buffet breakfast. we also had a wonderful time strolling around the garden enjoying the cold weather in tagaytay while we had an amazing view of the taal volcano. the hotel staff are hospitable and accommodating and we really planned to be back there with our kids very soon.,Jan,15,2012,87,,
agoda,Although the room we got was in the older part it was clean and near the pool area. The pool was small but was well kept. The area was expansive so one has a lot of place to walk around and relax and enjoy the view without bumping with another soul. All in all it was a nice stay.,Jan,12,2012,63,,
agoda,It was an amazing stay. The rooms are a bit old but the bed is comfortable it makes you disregard the age of the hotel. We stayed in one of their suites the only thing i didnt like is that the phone is just right beside the bed only so if you're at the receiving area you have to go all the way inside again. And the housekeeping service is just a bit slow,Jan,09,2012,87,,
agoda,we really able to rest although the rooms are too far from the amenities but we had a perfect time as a family,Jan,08,2012,97,,
agoda,The hotel is great with a great view of taal volcano...we were greeted with nice smile of the staff...we were supposed to in superior room but it's full so we were blessed to have delux room with no extra charge...breakfast buffet is superb!,Jan,07,2012,80,,
agoda,accomodating staff  prompt room service  close to a lot of great places to dine in tagaytay with a spectacular view of the Taal Lake. great weather too!,Jan,06,2012,83,,
agoda,We spent our Christmas in tagaytay to feel the true breeze of the holiday season. Our room is clean and spacious with comfy king size bed! The food was also great and the taal view is splendid! My only negative comment is that they were not able to clean up the room after we were out the whole day. I expected the room to be tidy again. We dialled housekeeping and they came after 1 hour. But in general  i will still come back to Taal vista on our next visit to tagaytay.,Jan,05,2012,63,,
agoda,The hotel itself is ok. The grounds are extensive and the view if A-ok. However the room we got is on the other side far from the view although a plus is that we got a connecting door to the adjacent room good for those with extended family members also staying there.,Jan,05,2012,67,,
agoda,the food was simply lacking in taste. moreover  we signed on using; the package included breakfast only.,Jan,05,2012,70,,
agoda,Staffs are friendly and attentive. The hotel has nice View of Taal Volcano and Taal Lake.,Jan,04,2012,60,,
agoda,We had a nice stay. Hotel staffs were very helpful and courteous. Check in and check out was a breeze. One comment though  rooms and toilets needs upgrading.,Jan,03,2012,80,,
agoda,I had a comfortable stay in this hotel. I got a Deluxe room and it had a king-sized bed and a single bed. It has a veranda which opens up to a spacious lawn where it is easy to walk and view the lake. Food is good and the staff are friendly and helpful. I will come back to this hotel.,Jan,03,2012,93,,
agoda,generally satisfactory  but it is necessary to contact mgers directly  not bell staff  if you have a problem. Remember that answer yes from the Philippinos is not always yes.,Dec,22,2011,53,,
agoda,The minute we checked in  we were greeted by the warm staff of the hotel. Also  few things stood out instantly  one would be the explicit formality of the people and second was the type of market this hotel caters to. One of the employees at the front desk asked me to fill out a form first which I kinda feel not necessary at the time since I already provided the information they needed during my online booking plus Summit Ridge Hotel which I personally think is at par with Taal Vista didn't hassle me with all the paperwork. Anyway the massive disappointment came when we found out that our room is located at the West Wing  which seriously needs an overhaul. Everything bout the building screams old and even requires some repainting to be done. It looks like an old dormitory to me rather than a hotel that has an expensive price tag. When we got inside  the room looks okay at first  spacious with a floor area of at least 30 sq meter and equipped with all the basic things you might need during your stay. However it lacks innovative features you would expect from a hotel like this  wifi connection is really bad  the TV looks super yesterday to me and to make it even worse  the hotel experienced a power outage in the middle of the night (literally  I think it was about 11 or 12 midnight) I had to tell Jillian (front desk officer) that we couldn't sleep because the room gets hotter and hotter by the minute before he finally said that he would send someone to transfer us to the another room! And that only happened after I made several calls already! Morning came and we had buffet breakfast  food was great so it somehow made up for the rough night we had before that. They have a wide array of food you can choose from plus the employees assigned in the restaurant were reasonably attentive to whatever their guest might need. On a holistic perspective  I would give this hotel a 3 out of 5 rating. It is definitely a place for the entire family and not for yuppies,Dec,02,2011,63,,
agoda,we enjoyed the panoramic view of taal  while waiting to be accomodated inside the room. Comfort room is dirty as well as the bed sheets  that made me asked the housekeeping to do it again. The airconditioning is not working good  so we didn't sleep well.,Nov,12,2011,50,,
agoda,generally okay  except the beds were small (single),Nov,04,2011,87,,
agoda,stayed for 2 nights in early oct 2011  we enjoyed the free welcome drink and had a couple more while listning to the great live music in the lobby bar. the breakfast was great with an excellent variety of foods. service was great. views down to taal lake were good once the fog / clouds cleared up. one morning was completely clouded in but thats not the hotels fault. i would certainly recommend this hotel and indeed the location in general,Oct,13,2011,83,,
agoda,the room was big. breakfast was good and the view was great.,Oct,13,2011,97,,
agoda,stayed on the old west side  which can't be really describedas 5 star. furniture needs fixing  paint on the walls is already old. minibar empty  old box type tv. would rate the west side only to 3 stars and for that the pricing is way too high.,Oct,11,2011,83,,
agoda,I was very happy the way the staff of the hotel treated us they were all friendly and accomodating.Considering the age of the building  they were able to keep the place in a very relaxing atmosphere and environment. The food that they serve in the resto were all delicious and exciting  I was always tempted to try huge variety of food. The only downside was with modern technologies that we have in communication the WI-FI was not available in the main lobby.,Sep,22,2011,80,,
agoda,generally is good  but the noise of other guest can easily heard inside the room,Sep,18,2011,87,,
agoda,The view was exceptional. We would definitely recommend spending more to have a room with a view of the volcano. Even while relaxing in our room we could look out our big window and enjoy the spectacular site. The staff was well-trained and able to fulfill our requests with ease. They even gave us helpful reminders when travelling down to the volcano site  which is definitely worth a visit. Perhaps though they should have warned us about the badgering of the locals at volcano site. We visited in low season and found the hotel very quiet and without the aircon running in the main lobby area where you can sit and order drinks and food. After we sweated it out for 2 days we asked the staff about it and they had it switched on immediately. Overall an excellent location  with awesome view.,Sep,08,2011,57,,

agoda,very satisfied with our stay in this hotel. the view is spectacular and the free breakfast buffet is superior. the guest officers are very helpful and attentive. one room for improvement is to do a renovation to some of its room. its quite getting old already.,Aug,10,2011,100,,
agoda,very nice view and weather  need to improve cleanliness inside the room,Jul,27,2011,87,,
agoda,My family and I went during father's day weekend so there was quite a que during check-in and check out. The room we got did not have a view and the aircon was quite warm that we had to move the bed directly to the spot in front of the aircon. The food during breakfast was yummy but service was quite slow due to the number of guests.,Jun,28,2011,77,,
agoda,stress from our flight and travel from mla to hotel via commute but it worth it.. we've stayed at premier room west wing... so nice the view from our balcony... all the staff there are hospitable.. when you pass by them  they will stop from their work and greet you with a smile.. thank you to the staff of taal vista from making our 1st vacation there a wonderful one... thank you..,Jun,20,2011,87,,
agoda,it was a wonderful place to stay. very nice and accomodating staff of the hotel. great place to rest after a long day tour in other part of tagaytay and next town. very relaxing the weather atmosphere  it's really awesome!,May,06,2011,100,,
agoda,There are 2 parts to the hotel  the older section and a new build section. Both offer perfect quality and an incredible view on the volcano. There also a place to sit outside in the garden. All offer the same perfect view. Although not cheap  i'll definatly use this hotel again and again.,May,01,2011,87,,
agoda,We were greeted by a very efficient and polite staff. Without our asking  were upgraded to bigger rooms with a delightful view of the Taal volcano. The rooms were spacious and clean. We area family of 5 with different food preferences but each of us enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The pool was clean and well maintained.,Apr,15,2011,87,,
agoda,We stayed for a night at the Taal Vista and overall I have to say it was rather disappointing. For a five star hotel which has recently undergone a rennovation we found the rooms very tired and dated. The television in our room was broken and the view from our window looked out on a junk yard at the back of the building. The hotel also did not provide any free wireless internet even in the lobby and instead were offering 1 hour internet connection for a 1000 pesos! The bar and restaurant are picturesque and the view from the terrace down to the Taal Volcano is spectacular but the truth is the hotel seems to trade solely on the view it offers of the Taal Volcano and is disappointing in most other respects.,Apr,15,2011,50,,
agoda,Nice hotel  good service  friendly staff  food and drinks are not superb but not bad neither  average or just above. Same for breakfast. Location is ok  many restaurants nearby (+- 1 km  Bali and Paluto were nice (with Karaoke options). Shopping mall not far away. Volcano's to be visited by boat.,Mar,15,2011,73,,
agoda,Poorly Maintained Rooms - The paint and everything is old.,Mar,14,2011,47,,
