We stayed in the mounting wing for our first night. The room had a nice view. But the room in this wing seemed outdated compared to the Lake wing rooms. Sadly  the shower drain we had in our room wasn't working properly. It was flooding every time we had to use the shower. We had requested to change rooms for our second night. Also  there was an on-going construction in the mountain wing but they weren't noisy or too obstructive.,11-Jul-17,,neg,booking
The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view  we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view  of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall  it was a  good comfortable stay.,11-Jul-17,,pos,booking

A better wifi connection in the entire room  booked a suite room but cannot connect with the wifi in the living room.  They don't cater/allow an extra bed.  Better to have more options on their breakfast menu especially on their dessert station.  The rooms (since we booked three rooms) are not well maintained- the bathtubs have no drain stopper/cover and peeling finish (even in the suite room) and the old wooden doors are damaged especially their edges.,21-Sep-17,,neg,booking
The place was just perfect & what we needed for a relaxing overnight stay.  It was raining the day we checked in  but we had a wonderful sleep  thanks to the in-room massage we had!  The weather got better the following day so I woke up to the beautiful site of the Taal Lake and its surroundings.  It was just breath-taking!  There was a variety of choices for breakfast  and I was even able to request for hot choco!  Yum!  The walk around the hotel grounds was relaxing and nice  and the shop inside the hotel was convenient (I forgot to bring a shirt  but got one there.).  The front desk ladies were pleasant  and all the hotel staff were polite and friendly wherever you meet them.  It was a great experience overall!  Would stay again! :),21-Sep-17,,pos,booking

Hotel could have informed us  that there was a ongoing food convention at our (lakeview) wing. The music started at 6am in the morning and the loud bass literally 'shaked' me out of bed. We would have safed ourselves the overpriced 'upgrade' to the room w/ lakeview (which we thought  we already had booked through booking.com). Which brings me to the next point: room description should include: view to courtyard/view to lake.  One last thing: the lakeview wing is right next to the sky ranch amusement park. It is loud and you can hear people screaming from the rollercoaster. If you are looking for something more quite  ask for the mountain view wing. (No view of the beautiful lake thou) Would still recommend the hotel for families w/ kids and honeymooners. Not so much for travelers on a budget/group of friends wo like adventure (as the is nothing really to do except the volcano hike.),26 April 2017,,neg,booking

We wanted to make sure so we called  the front desk after 2 hours to verify  only to find it  it wasnt noted down. What if we didnt call to double check?

UGH! the WI-FI has no signal at the MOUNTAIN WING  while they have weak signal at the the LAKE WING. The presidential suite needs to be renovated. I think they need to renovate ALL the rooms at the mountain wing.  I think they should hire a landscape architect too. They have beautiful trees & plants but it's too unorganized.,2-Nov-16,,neg,booking
Our room (2 bedroom deluxe suite) was spacious and perfect for our family. The hotel grounds are lovely and our 2 year old had a grand time running around. The hotel also has direct access to the Skyranch and this was a huge bonus for us. Since traffic in Tagaytay could be a bummer  it's great that we had a lot of things to do inside the hotel. The food (breakfast buffet and a la carte choices in the Lobby Lounge) was good  too.,2-Nov-16,,pos,booking

My family is regular here. Whenever we go to Tagaytay  we stay at their hotel. We love the view of the Taal Lake from their premises.  The spa has amazing service. I usually complain & bruise a lot from other spa's services BUT NOT here :). My sister & I like Shiela because of her amazing skills in massage. The food from the lobby is great. My family likes to stay there most of the time while drinking coffee/hot choco & eating cake. Great ambience! I love the piano pieces. My parents love the singers. The buffet ...hmmm... it's decent. We just noticed that everytime we go there  the choices of the food is decreasing. We don't know. I must say that they used to have several choices.  The Taza has amazing pizza. Great ambience! great staff too!  Hmmm...did you try the room service? you should! we love it! leche flan turon & mixed veggies <3 <3 <3 AMAZING STAFF SERVICE! ....and I hope it stays that way!

The rooms are far from the lobby.  The hallways are long  there are no chairs to at least rest after the long walk.  The elevator is not strategically located and you will lose your breath if you are getting the room with balcony.  There's another elevator that you can reach after climbing the stairs.  Not advisable for seniors but they have wheelchairs for those who need assistance. My mom stayed in the room alone until I arrived before midnight  creepy but she said she heard someone snoring behind her while she was sitting by the writing table.  Not sure if there are stories of this kind in the same room  just wanted to let you know :)  We just slept with the TV and lights on instead. :) CIGNAL's cable signal goes on and off.,25-Jan-16,,neg,booking
I like that the hotel is far from the busy area near Lourdes Church though a quiet place for a church is much appreciated. The room is spacious but VERY FAR TO REACH!  Bathroom is also spacious with complimentary toiletries.  They have an iron and ironing board.  The bed is comfortable.  Take note that we stayed in the new building. The buffet has a lot of choices and are being refilled as soon as it's empty.  They have a good spread.  They have juices and fruits.  The bread items are a bit hard.  Staff are very helpful.

The aircon and fridge in our room needs a replacement --- the aircon keeps a fairly comfortable 23-25 degree room temp despite being set at 18 degrees at maximum fan  thanks to the cool weather outside at the time; and the fridge cools the complimentary bottled water after at least 12 hours despite a maximum cooling setting.  Understandably the Mountain Wing is pretty dated but good management should not have waited for guest comments to address a basic housekeeping/engineering issue like this. Front office staff should refrain from making promises that could not be delivered  such as offering to send a fruit basket to the room for our wedding anniversary  but nada.,12-Jul-17,54,neg,booking

Well  in the middle of the night the aircon is not working. I woke up and call them  wait them until they finish working after more than an hour. At breakfast this girl in the reception buffet area is so choosy to the guest. When we get there she asked us what room number and  she turned her back to us to assist another guest  then after that she assist me again by telling me that we could sit OUTSIDE the buffet area because the sits are all reserved. I said to her that other dining area is not allowed because i ask the other employee about that and then i said that no one is sitting in that couch (inside the buffet dining area)  She just said that if i could share my table to someone else  and said fine. While  eating i noticed that this receptionist is likes to entertain mostly with foreigners. If  foreigners the sits are available. What a shame.  Well  the food is not worthy also.. and no one dare to share my table because there are a lot of empty tables...,21 April 2017,,neg,booking

The hotel is old. Supposed to be historical but really it's just old and worn out  rough around the edges. All the money they charge appears to be going into someone's pocket as it clearly isn't being invested back into the hotel. Most rooms do not have a view so do be surprised if your window faces a wall or the casino across the street. No service at the pool. 150php for a bucket of ice. Breakfast buffet isn't really all that great especially when considering this hotel is supposed to be super awesome. Rooms are very basic and worn out. Mold and mildew on shower walls. Bathroom sink enamel completely worn through in some places. Hair in bathtub upon arriving. Mattress is old and isn't attached to the wall so it easily slides away from the wall of you try to sit up and lean against the wall. Linens are also very worn out (sheets and blanket and towels). There is only one outlet that works with 3 prong plugs (e.g. Laptop cable) and not conveniently located. Room really seems more like a cheap motel than an elegant hotel. For the cost one should have pretty high expectations. Be warned you should lower your expectations. Then lower them some more.  There are a bunch of hotels and b&b along the ridge  you can probably save some money and stay at a better place if you look around. Don't waste your money here. If you have to leave your room to see the view anyway then stay somewhere less expensive and spend the day at various points. You can always just come visit the hotel property if you want this particular view. Oh yeah  and the layout is a little weird. Depending on which room you get be prepared to do a lot of walking. A lot. Read other people's reviews  you'll see a pattern.,14 April 2017,,neg,booking

I didn't like the snobbish attitude of your front desk.  I requested something special to be set up on the room for my wife  they didn't listen to my request.  The room that we got was very old  it feels like very 90's  the shower and tub was too old and had hair on the drainage.  I had to request someone to untangle the plug from the drainage as we couldn't use the tub.  Come breakfast time  we went to the Veranda and requested for a coffee.  I'm not sure if the staff is trained well on hospitality specifically on how to brew coffee but it tasted like water (no bitter coffee taste at all).  Ofcourse the pastries were cold and dry  but I think that's why theres someone there to have it toasted.  Overall  it's overrated  overpriced and very old.  You'll be better off at a newer hotel with upbeat staff than this one.,16-Feb-17,10,neg,booking
Bedroom sliding window door didnt fully closed so anyone could have gained access to my room through the patio. Poor bathroom lighting to put on make-up.

In addition to P9 500.00 the hotel staff made me deposit an undisclosed amount of P2 000.00. Even if I was okay to paying said amount  the staff's service was less than okay. We were made to wait more than 1 hour to get our room. When we got to our room  we were also surprised to find that the windows weren't closed properly.

I have stayed in this hotel twice. The first time  in 2013  was in the Lake Wing. I remember there being a lot of noise from Sky Ranch Park  are really inconvenient path to our room through a ballroom and up a flight of stairs before reaching the elevator (this is important if you're traveling with people with disabilities)  and incredibly bad service.  Despite deciding at that point that I would not return to this hotel  I decided to give it another chance in early 2016  in the Mountain Wing.  This wing is considerably older than the Lake wing  and while generally clean and maintained  the quality of our room was underwhelming.  On top of this  a regular stream of noisy guests in the hallway kept us up from 11pm to 3am. As they loud guests were always different  it didn't appear that calling the front desk would reduce the problem. When complaining to the Manager in the morning  I was again underwhelmed by the customer service.,16-Feb-16,,neg,booking

We arrived at the hotel few minutes before 1pm. We were allowed to check in. After the SOP  for checking in  we were informed that we have to wait for a few more minutes since our room is still being prepared. We obliged as we understand that standard check in time is 2pm. After a few minutes  I checked with the front desk officer if the room is ready. I was informed that it is still being cleaned and will be finished at exactly 2pm. While we were sitted at the lobby  we noticed that some guests who have checked in were allowed to proceed to their rooms right away. So I approached the front desk officer again and told him that we noticed. I was in a different tone  when I aporoached him. I told him that we booked our room one month before and we are not walk in guests. Why do we still have to wait for 2pm while other guests are allowed to proceed to their room right after checking in. He went inside a room behind the front desk. When he returned  he told me that we can now proceed to our room. Initially he said that the room will be available at 2pm. But when I approached him in a different tone  he told me that the room is ready. He was apologetic but did not give any explanation to what happened. Also  we were not able to use their wifi because of poor signal. Tried to ask the staff one time and she just gave me a new password. I did not bother to insists on the wifi because of bad experience that we had checking in.,28-Dec-15,,neg,booking

The front desk were extremely inefficient. I had to transfer rooms because I asked to stay an extra night (I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place)  but I obliged because a guest was checking in and wanted 3 rooms next to each other (one of which was my room). But since I had to prepare for a wedding  I wanted to transfer early and was told I could transfer by 9AM). At 9  they sent a bellhop to get our things but he had no idea where we were transferring to. The front desk personnel who arranged the transfer went on break. No one could resolve the issue and we were transferred at 11:00! The wedding I had to prepare for and travel to was at 12NN.,21-Dec-15,,neg,booking

Air conditioner was leaking and the room was too warm.  We reported to front desk and they said they'd send someone to fix it.  It wasn't fixed and basically  the front desk person said there was nothing they could do because they couldn't transfer us to other rooms - the hotel was fully booked.  So we still paid the ridiculous price for a room that was uncomfortable and too warm.  They didn't do anything to at least address our complaint.  It was as if...too bad  you're-already-here-so-just bear-with-it kind of case.  The staff were obviously not trained to handle a simple case such as this.  No warmth  no empathy...robotic kind of service. To further validate that we made the wrong choice of staying in this hotel....during breakfast  one of the staff was insisting that my son  9 years old  was an adult.  So I told her to go ahead and interview him herself  and ask for his birth date and whatever qualifying questions she had in mind.  Disappointing.  Assuming that we probably just want to pay half the price of the buffet so we were saying he was below 11.  Annoying....especially when we slept in an uncomfortable state given that the hotel's air conditioner was busted!  Then you see the buffet table fruit selection covered with fruit flies.  Hope this comment reaches the hotel's management team....because obviously...from facilities to staff...you need a total revamp.,8-Nov-15,,neg,booking

The design of the bathroom makes it easier for us to keep it dry.  This is a classic hotel that could last for decades because it placed priority on the needs of the guests OVER THE  AESTHETICS.

I requested an extra bed before we arrived  wasn't provided one. I followed it up the day we arrived  receptionist said will speak with housekeeping. Still no extra bed  and I was still charged for it!  Plus charges should be incurred upon booking  so people would know the ACTUAL price before booking. Plus  housekeeping was changing our linen while we were in the room. That is a first for me in all of the hotels we've booked before.

We were expecting for a good view  but we were given a room with a view of the rooftop and windows of the other rooms.  There was no bidet in the toilet and the way the toilet was designed  there was no door towards the inner room going to the shower area and the toilet room.  That's why the smell from the toilet comes out into the whole room. The aircon was leaking  but was eventually repaired when we called the front desk.  We asked for ice and some other requests but until we checked out  our requests were not attended to.,3-Nov-16,50,neg,booking

Expected more for price and rating.  Noisy hotel  can hear everything from guests in other rooms  slamming of doors. Long walks to rooms  smell and feeling is a bit like a hospital! Food quality average  fast food style. Seevice slow and staff needed reminding that youd ordered. Breakfast choice poor  fried  unhealthy. Coffee is poor.

We found the room facilities to be very dated and old. Granted  it's an old hotel but a lot of their fixtures (and floors) need to be updated. We got a mountain view room and it wasn't so much a view of a mountain but more a view of the neighboring empty lot. One would expect more for the price you have to pay for the room  It was 5 200 plus in Booking.com but amounted to 6 500 when we got there (Plus there was a 2k deposit).,26-Jul-16,,neg,booking

I didn't expect for a 5-star hotel to have those kind of mattress pillows. 3-star hotels in Makati are even better.   Even worse...the electrical sockets available are type A sockets only. Luckily there was usb port in their LCD tv and I managed to charged my phone. But really disappointed  the rest of my devices weren't charged because all of my chargers are type E.
