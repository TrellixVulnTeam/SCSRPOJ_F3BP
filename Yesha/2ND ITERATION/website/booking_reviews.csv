booking,We were given the wrong area lake view 419instead of mountain view ( written - check in paper). No one assisted us so we walked on our own to reach the area. We saw a guard but instructed as to go to different area(from right side towards the left most side- mountain view to lake view). Upon reaching there  we were told that we have to walk all the way to the other side of the property.  And that 419 is mountain view n not lake view. They told us that the paper was wrong. We were carrying our bags by ourselves with no one assisting  or guiding us.,2015-10-12,neg

booking,The food in the veranda for the ala carte menu is not to up to par.  The crispy liempo is OVER FRIED.  The bulalo did not do justice.   We know how it should taste!  The servings and portions are too small.  Try to come up with group meals.,2015-10-13,neg

booking,The Mountain Wing room I was in was old. The screen sliding door to the patio kept coming off the rail and I had to fix it every time we went in and out (We hung out in the patio a lot). The coffee maker still had water (probably) from the previous guest. The rubber slip mat in the bathtub was visibly old and should be replaced. Lastly  I was not given a choice to choose a room in the newer and better Lake Wing (where I had previously stayed and was very satisfied) when I booked online.,2015-10-14,neg

Thanks to concierge  front office  restaurant staff  Housekeeping and Security staff.,2015-11-08,pos
booking,Air conditioner was leaking and the room was too warm.  We reported to front desk and they said they'd send someone to fix it.  It wasn't fixed and basically  the front desk person said there was nothing they could do because they couldn't transfer us to other rooms - the hotel was fully booked.  So we still paid the ridiculous price for a room that was uncomfortable and too warm.  They didn't do anything to at least address our complaint.  It was as if...too bad  you're-already-here-so-just bear-with-it kind of case.  The staff were obviously not trained to handle a simple case such as this.  No warmth  no empathy...robotic kind of service. To further validate that we made the wrong choice of staying in this hotel....during breakfast  one of the staff was insisting that my son  9 years old  was an adult.  So I told her to go ahead and interview him herself  and ask for his birth date and whatever qualifying questions she had in mind.  Disappointing.  Assuming that we probably just want to pay half the price of the buffet so we were saying he was below 11.  Annoying....especially when we slept in an uncomfortable state given that the hotel's air conditioner was busted!  Then you see the buffet table fruit selection covered with fruit flies.  Hope this comment reaches the hotel's management team....because obviously...from facilities to staff...you need a total revamp.,2015-11-08,neg

I had to transfer rooms because I asked to stay an extra night (I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place)  but I obliged because a guest was checking in and wanted 3 rooms next to each other (one of which was my room). But since I had to prepare for a wedding  I wanted to transfer early and was told I could transfer by 9AM). At 9  they sent a bellhop to get our things but he had no idea where we were transferring to. The front desk personnel who arranged the transfer went on break. No one could resolve the issue and we were transferred at 11:00! The wedding I had to prepare for and travel to was at 12NN.,2015-12-21,neg

booking,We arrived at the hotel few minutes before 1pm. We were allowed to check in. After the SOP  for checking in  we were informed that we have to wait for a few more minutes since our room is still being prepared. We obliged as we understand that standard check in time is 2pm. After a few minutes  I checked with the front desk officer if the room is ready. I was informed that it is still being cleaned and will be finished at exactly 2pm. While we were sitted at the lobby  we noticed that some guests who have checked in were allowed to proceed to their rooms right away. So I approached the front desk officer again and told him that we noticed. I was in a different tone  when I aporoached him. I told him that we booked our room one month before and we are not walk in guests. Why do we still have to wait for 2pm while other guests are allowed to proceed to their room right after checking in. He went inside a room behind the front desk. When he returned  he told me that we can now proceed to our room. Initially he said that the room will be available at 2pm. But when I approached him in a different tone  he told me that the room is ready. He was apologetic but did not give any explanation to what happened. Also  we were not able to use their wifi because of poor signal. Tried to ask the staff one time and she just gave me a new password. I did not bother to insists on the wifi because of bad experience that we had checking in.,2015-12-28,neg

The elevator is not strategically located and you will lose your breath if you are getting the room with balcony.  There's another elevator that you can reach after climbing the stairs.  Not advisable for seniors but they have wheelchairs for those who need assistance. My mom stayed in the room alone until I arrived before midnight  creepy but she said she heard someone snoring behind her while she was sitting by the writing table.  Not sure if there are stories of this kind in the same room  just wanted to let you know :)  We just slept with the TV and lights on instead. :) CIGNAL's cable signal goes on and off.,2016-01-25,neg

booking,I have stayed in this hotel twice. The first time  in 2013  was in the Lake Wing. I remember there being a lot of noise from Sky Ranch Park  are really inconvenient path to our room through a ballroom and up a flight of stairs before reaching the elevator (this is important if you're traveling with people with disabilities)  and incredibly bad service.  Despite deciding at that point that I would not return to this hotel  I decided to give it another chance in early 2016  in the Mountain Wing.  This wing is considerably older than the Lake wing  and while generally clean and maintained  the quality of our room was underwhelming.  On top of this  a regular stream of noisy guests in the hallway kept us up from 11pm to 3am. As they loud guests were always different  it didn't appear that calling the front desk would reduce the problem.

I usually complain & bruise a lot from other spa's services BUT NOT here :). My sister & I like Shiela because of her amazing skills in massage. The food from the lobby is great. My family likes to stay there most of the time while drinking coffee/hot choco & eating cake. Great ambience! I love the piano pieces. My parents love the singers. The buffet ...hmmm... it's decent. We just noticed that everytime we go there  the choices of the food is decreasing. We don't know. I must say that they used to have several choices.  The Taza has amazing pizza. Great ambience! great staff too!  Hmmm...did you try the room service? you should! we love it! leche flan turon & mixed veggies <3 <3 <3 AMAZING STAFF SERVICE! ....and I hope it stays that way!

booking,The hotel is a little bit old. Based on our experience  SOME rooms have broken hot/cold showers  dripping A/Cs  stagnant water in some areas whenever it rains.  UGH! the WI-FI has no signal at the MOUNTAIN WING  while they have weak signal at the the LAKE WING. The presidential suite needs to be renovated. I think they need to renovate ALL the rooms at the mountain wing.  I think they should hire a landscape architect too. They have beautiful trees & plants but it's too unorganized.,2016-11-02,neg
booking,Our room (2 bedroom deluxe suite) was spacious and perfect for our family. The hotel grounds are lovely and our 2 year old had a grand time running around. The hotel also has direct access to the Skyranch and this was a huge bonus for us. Since traffic in Tagaytay could be a bummer  it's great that we had a lot of things to do inside the hotel.

That's why the smell from the toilet comes out into the whole room. The aircon was leaking  but was eventually repaired when we called the front desk.

booking,Taal Vista Hotel continues to be the best established hotel in Tagaytay City. Its been there for decades and the service and facilities remain fresh. It also remains to be one of the best located hotel/resorts in town  with the best view along Tagaytay ridge. The rooms are spacious and the staff are extremely friendly.

booking,A lot of undisclosed charges when I booked. I booked it for P7 700 but when I was made to pay at the front desk  they told me that the final amount was P9 500. In addition to P9 500.00 the hotel staff made me deposit an undisclosed amount of P2 000.00. Even if I was okay to paying said amount  the staff's service was less than okay. We were made to wait more than 1 hour to get our room. When we got to our room  we were also surprised to find that the windows weren't closed properly. We only found out when we could hear the full boom of the fireworks at night. The breakfast was mediocre as well.,2017-02-13,neg

booking,I didn't like the snobbish attitude of your front desk.  I requested something special to be set up on the room for my wife  they didn't listen to my request.  The room that we got was very old  it feels like very 90's  the shower and tub was too old and had hair on the drainage.  I had to request someone to untangle the plug from the drainage as we couldn't use the tub.  Come breakfast time  we went to the Veranda and requested for a coffee.  I'm not sure if the staff is trained well on hospitality specifically on how to brew coffee but it tasted like water (no bitter coffee taste at all).  Ofcourse the pastries were cold and dry  but I think that's why theres someone there to have it toasted.  Overall  it's overrated  overpriced and very old.  You'll be better off at a newer hotel with upbeat staff than this one.,2017-02-16,neg

Another thing was that the Samsung tv is broken meaning there are white lines on the tv so we couldn't really play the game.,2017-02-19,pos
booking,Dinner of Feb.14 2017. It took more than 1-1/2 hour to be served.

My wife and  I  went up Tagaytay very Hungry and  needs  to  catch up with our booking. But it is forgivable. Do not worry about it.

booking,Hotel could have informed us  that there was a ongoing food convention at our (lakeview) wing. The music started at 6am in the morning and the loud bass literally 'shaked' me out of bed. We would have safed ourselves the overpriced 'upgrade' to the room w/ lakeview (which we thought  we already had booked through booking.com). Which brings me to the next point: room description should include: view to courtyard/view to lake.  One last thing: the lakeview wing is right next to the sky ranch amusement park. It is loud and you can hear people screaming from the rollercoaster. If you are looking for something more quite  ask for the mountain view wing. (No view of the beautiful lake thou) Would still recommend the hotel for families w/ kids and honeymooners. Not so much for travelers on a budget/group of friends wo like adventure (as the is nothing really to do except the volcano hike.),2017-04-27,neg

When we get there she asked us what room number and  she turned her back to us to assist another guest  then after that she assist me again by telling me that we could sit OUTSIDE the buffet area because the sits are all reserved. I said to her that other dining area is not allowed because i ask the other employee about that and then i said that no one is sitting in that couch (inside the buffet dining area)  She just said that if i could share my table to someone else  and said fine. While  eating i noticed that this receptionist is likes to entertain mostly with foreigners. If  foreigners the sits are available. What a shame.

booking,The hotel is old. Supposed to be historical but really it's just old and worn out  rough around the edges. All the money they charge appears to be going into someone's pocket as it clearly isn't being invested back into the hotel. Most rooms do not have a view so do be surprised if your window faces a wall or the casino across the street. No service at the pool. 150php for a bucket of ice. Breakfast buffet isn't really all that great especially when considering this hotel is supposed to be super awesome. Rooms are very basic and worn out. Mold and mildew on shower walls. Bathroom sink enamel completely worn through in some places. Hair in bathtub upon arriving. Mattress is old and isn't attached to the wall so it easily slides away from the wall of you try to sit up and lean against the wall. Linens are also very worn out (sheets and blanket and towels). There is only one outlet that works with 3 prong plugs (e.g. Laptop cable) and not conveniently located. Room really seems more like a cheap motel than an elegant hotel. For the cost one should have pretty high expectations. Be warned you should lower your expectations. Then lower them some more.  There are a bunch of hotels and b&b along the ridge  you can probably save some money and stay at a better place if you look around. Don't waste your money here. If you have to leave your room to see the view anyway then stay somewhere less expensive and spend the day at various points. You can always just come visit the hotel property if you want this particular view. Oh yeah  and the layout is a little weird. Depending on which room you get be prepared to do a lot of walking. A lot. Read other people's reviews  you'll see a pattern.,2017-05-21,neg

Understandably the Mountain Wing is pretty dated but good management should not have waited for guest comments to address a basic housekeeping/engineering issue like this. Front office staff should refrain from making promises that could not be delivered  such as offering to send a fruit basket to the room for our wedding anniversary  but nada.,2017-07-12,neg

booking,The bathroom is not very clean. The shower not functioning very well. They need to renovate,2017-10-08,neg
booking,I like the size of the room and the bathroom.  It has enough space for me to move around.  I like that they have a clothes line inside the bathroom.  The design of the bathroom makes it easier for us to keep it dry.  This is a classic hotel that could last for decades because it placed priority on the needs of the guests OVER THE  AESTHETICS.  Never mind if it is not trendy or modern BUT it kept the guests' needs first!,2017-10-08,pos
